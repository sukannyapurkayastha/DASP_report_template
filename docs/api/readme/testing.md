## **5 Testing**

We adopted a multi-level testing strategy to ensure both reliability and maintainability across our application:

*Unit Tests*

Implemented extensively for backend modules and individual model components.
Validate each function's correctness, focusing on data loading, preprocessing methods, and core inference logic in isolation.

*Integration Tests*

Primarily target the frontend and its interactions with the backend APIs.
Assess end-to-end functionalityâ€”verifying that data flows correctly from the user interface, through the backend services, and back again with the expected responses and outputs.
