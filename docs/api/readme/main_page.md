# **Review Overview Generation**



At **Paper Review Aggregator**, our mission is to simplify the work of meta-reviewers by providing an AI-driven platform that aggregates and summarizes paper reviews. By reducing manual effort and enhancing decision-making, we aim to streamline the peer-review process for academic research.
This application was developed as part of the **"Data Analysis Software Project"** course at **Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany**. The project allowed Master’s students to apply their data analysis, software engineering, and machine learning skills to solve real-world problems.


**Contributions**

In this project participated Johannes Lemken, Carmen Appelt, Zhijingshui Yang, Philipp Oehler and Jan Werth.
We were supervised by Sukannya Purkayastha.
