5. lack of related work:  4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks, CVPR 2019.
2. Missed citation: MnasNet [2] also incorporates the cost of architectures in their search process.
The paper also misses relevant citations of similar questions from the field of (probabilistic) matrix factorization and relational learning.
(3) A large body of graph neural network literature is omitted.
The reviewer recommends the authors to read some literature review of the topic of GCN and re-organize the references, and use search engines to have a better view on the state of the art of (hyperbolic) geometric theories and graph convolutional networks.
This is a thriving area that requires a careful literature review.
2) Related work, although extensive in terms of the number of references, do not help to place this work in the literature.
Listing related work is no the same as describing similarities and differences compared to previous methods.
The paper misses the key baseline in Bayesian optimisation using tree structure [1] which can perform the prediction under the tree-structure dependencies.
There are some well-cited works that the authors may have missed. These are ultimately different approaches, but perhaps the authors can obtain some inspiration from these:
5, Although there is a notable difference, one may properly mention previous work Yamamoto et al. (2019), which uses GAN as an auxiliary loss within ClariNet and obtains high-fidelity speech ( https://r9y9.github.io/demos/projects/interspeech2019/ ).
5. The term "PowerSGD" seems to have been used by other papers.
