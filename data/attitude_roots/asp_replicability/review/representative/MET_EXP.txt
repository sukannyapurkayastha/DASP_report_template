- Did the experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet use the cosine learning rate schedule [1]? If or if not, either way, you should specify it in a revised version of this paper, e.g. did you use the cosine schedule in the first 120 steps to train the shared parameters W, did you use it in the retraining from scratch?
