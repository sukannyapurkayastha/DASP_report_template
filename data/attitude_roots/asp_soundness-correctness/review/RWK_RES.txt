1. Could you comment on the differences in your setup in Section 4.1 compared to the VAEAC paper? I’ve noticed that the results you report for this method significantly differ from the original paper, e.g. for VAEAC on Phishing dataset you report PFC of 0.24, whereas the original paper reports 0.394; for Mushroom it’s 0.403 vs. 0.244. I’ve compared the experimental details yet couldn’t find any differences, for example the missing rate is 0.5 in both papers.
It is not obvious that shuffling image patches at a particular scale would lead to complete loss of global information, but the paper does show results on SVHN and CIFAR10 for which global information is sufficiently disentangled.
