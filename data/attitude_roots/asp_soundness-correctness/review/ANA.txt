The convergence analysis is on Z, not on parameters x and hyper-parameters theta.
- The analysis in [1] handles the case of noisy updates, whereas the analysis given here only works for exact updates.
The presented analysis seems to neglect the error term corresponding to the value function.
Moreover, as observed by the authors this analysis currently rely on strong assumptions that might make it rather unrealistic.
There is a key concern about the feasibility of the numerical analysis for the first part.
Moreover, if I understand correctly the WGAN analysis does not take into account that G and D are non-linear, and it is unclear if these can be done.
- It is good that Section 5 has some theoretical analysis. But I personally find it very disturbing to base it on a 2nd order approximation of a probability density function of images when modeling something as intricate as models that generate images.
To evaluate the impact of the proposed changes in this paper, one would have to perform extended evaluations and ablations for the submission.
2.	What is the reason for using rule-based agents in all the experiments? It would have been more useful if all the analysis are done with RL agents rather than rule-based agents.
This has not been considered in the analysis.
