Yeh, Raymond A., et al. "Image Restoration with Deep Generative Models." 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2018.
Perhaps I missed it, but I believe Dan Ciresan's paper "Multi-Column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification" should be cited.
Citations used for Gradcam are wrong -- Sundarajan et al., 2016 should be changed to Selvaraju et al., 2017.
