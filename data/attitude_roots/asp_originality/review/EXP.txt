Simply because for continuous variables similar experiments have been reported before
Even though the proposed approach seems to have significant potential, the experimental
Also, I find the experiments done in section 3 and 4 are similar to previous works and even the conclusions are similar.
The experiments currently demonstrate that optimizing both controller and hardware is better than optimizing just the controller, which is not surprising and is a phenomenon which has been previously studied in the literature.
Originality: Given the existing body of literature, I found the technical novelty of this paper rather weak. However, it seems the experiments are thoroughly conducted.
If this all is indeed the case, it is not surprising that the numbers the authors get in the experiments are so similar to WAE-MMD, because CWAE would be exactly WAE-MMD with a specific choice of the kernel.
However the theoretical contribution is poor. And the experiment uses a very classical benchmark providing simulated data.
2. Although the experiments are detailed and interesting they support poor theoretical developments and use a very classical benchmark
