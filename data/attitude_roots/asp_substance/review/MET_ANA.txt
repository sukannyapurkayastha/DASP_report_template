-3 For image-to-image translation experiments, no quantitative analysis whatsoever is offered so the reader can't really conclude anything about the effect of the proposed method in this domain.
That said, I would like to see more analysis on the behavior of the proposed method under various interesting cases not tested yet.
5) Last but not least, convergence analysis of the proposed method should be provided given that asynchrony may lead to divergence in the optimization.
