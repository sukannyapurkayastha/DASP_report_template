- Given the small size of the dataset, I would propose experimenting with non-neural approaches as well, which are also quite common in NLG.
- experiments are performed using a synthetic setup on a single data set, so it remains unclear if the algorithm would be successful in a real life scenario
The experimental settings, e.g. how the train:test datasets are split, and hyperparameter settings, are not clearly given.
Moreover, I  don't think that the data sets in experiments are good enough to cover the importance and the nature of the problem.
