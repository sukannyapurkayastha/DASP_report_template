In general, the space that was used to explain the Transformer baselines---which are essentially straightforward ways to adapt transformers to this task---could have been used to give more detail on the dataset.
1. What are the key limitations of AutoLoss ? Did we observe some undesirable behavior of the learned optimization schedule, especially when transfer between different datasets or different models ?
Does the discriminator exclude the poisoning data according to certain rule?
But there is no attempt to generalize the findings (e.g. new datasets not from original study, changing other parameters and then evaluating again if these techniques help etc.), not clear
