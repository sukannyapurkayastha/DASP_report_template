The contributions of the method could also be underlined more clearly in the abstract and introduction.
- The digression at the bottom of the first page about neural architecture search seem out of context and interrupts the flow of the introduction.
First, it is somewhat misleading about its contributions: it's not obvious from abstract/introduction that the whole model is the same as DIP except for the proposed architecture.
The introduction can start at a lower level (such as flat/hyperbolic neural networks).
10.	The title suggests that the paper studies multiple VQA models but only a single model is studied.
I do not understand the "deep integration of MARL and HRL" that is claimed in the Introduction.
* In the introduction, "the classical approach" is mentioned but to be the latter is
