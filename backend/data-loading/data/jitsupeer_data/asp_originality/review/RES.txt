Although some promising
Hence, I kindly do not think the outcome is truly a research result.
As the authors admit, the main result is not especially surprising.
The results are not strong. And, unfortunately, the model contribution currently is too modest.
I find the observations interesting, but the contribution is empirical and not entirely new. It would be nice if there were some theoretical results to back up the observations.
Although I personally enjoyed reading the results that from control theory perspective are inline with GAN literature, the paper does not provide novel surprising results.
However, this limits the novelty of the results relative to existing literature.
2) although there must be some small innovations, I thought that all the results had more or less been proven by Dupuis and co-authors:
It was kind of surprising that the authors did not cite this paper given the results are pretty much the same.
A lot of the times, the result seem to be a derivative of the work by Bietti and Mairal, and looks like the main results in this paper are intertwined with stuff B+M already showed in their paper.
- Page 7 offers a result (expression for the Dirichlet form), which is hardly more than an exercise for anybody familiar with Markov Chains theory.
Again, this follows from known results.
Many of the results have been already presented in
While I wish there were more such studies -- as I believe reproducing past results experimentally is important, and so is providing practical advice for practitioners -- this work in many parts hard to follow, and it is hard to get lot of new insight from the results, or a better understanding of GANs.
