The present paper proposes a fast approximation to the softmax computation when the number of classes is very large.,,arg_structuring,0
This is typically a bottleneck in deep learning architectures.,,arg_structuring,0
The approximation is a sparse two-layer mixture of experts.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper lacks rigor and the writing is of low quality, both in its clarity and its grammar.",,arg_evaluative,0
See a list of typos below.,,arg_structuring,0
"An example of lack of mathematical rigor is equation 4 in which the same variable name is used to describe the weights before and after pruning, as if it was computer code instead of an equation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also pervasive is the use of the asterisk to denote multiplication, again as if it was code and not math.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Algorithm 1 does not include mitosis, which may have an effect on the resulting approximation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"How are the lambda and threshold parameters tuned? The authors mention a validation set, are they just exhaustively explored on a 3D grid on the validation set?",,arg_request,1
"The results only compare with Shim et al. Why only this method? Why would it be expected to be faster than all the other alternatives? Wouldn't similar alternatives like the sparsely gated MoE, D-softmax and adaptive-softmax have chances of being faster?",,arg_request,1
"The column ""FLOPS"" in the result seems to measure the speedup, whereas the actual FLOPS should be less when the speed increases.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, a ""1x"" label seems to be missing in for the full softmax, so that the reference is clearly specified.",,arg_evaluative,0
"All in all, the results show that the proposed method provides a significant speedup with respect to Shim et al., but it lacks comparison with other methods in the literature.",,arg_evaluative,0

"This paper presents a method for adapting a model that has been trained to perform one task, so that it can perform a new task (potentially without using any new training data at all—i.e., zero-shot learning).",,arg_structuring,0
In some ways the presented work is a form of meta-learning or *meta-mapping* as the authors refer to it.,,arg_structuring,0
The premise of the paper is very interesting and the overall problem is definitely of high interest and high potential impact.,,arg_evaluative,0
I believe that the presentation of the proposed method can be significantly improved.,,arg_request,1
The method description was a bit confusing and unclear to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
The experimental results presented were all done on small synthetic datasets and it’s hard to evaluate whether the method is practically useful.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore, no comparisons were provided to any baselines/alternative methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, in Sections 4 and 5 I was hoping to see comparisons to methods like MAML.",,arg_request,1
"Also, I felt that the proposed approach in Section 5 is very similar to MAML intuitively. This makes a comparison with MAML even more desirable.",,arg_request,1
Without any comparisons it’s hard to tell how difficult the tasks under consideration are and what would amount to good performance on the held-out tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In summary, I feel the paper tackles an interesting problem with an interesting approach, but the content could be organized much better.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, this work would benefit significantly from a better experimental evaluation.",,arg_request,1
"For these reasons I lean towards rejecting this paper for now, but would love to see it refined for a future machine learning conference.",,arg_social,0
"Also, the work by Platanios, et al. on contextual parameter generation is very relevant to this work as it tackles multi-task learning using HyperNetworks.",,arg_fact,0
It may be worth adding a short discussion/comparison to that work as it also considers zero-shot learning.,,arg_request,1

"The paper shows that Bayesian neural networks, trained with Dropout MC (Gal et al.) struggle to fully capture the posterior distribution of the weights.",,arg_structuring,0
This leads to over-confident predictions which is problematic particularly in an active learning scenario.,,arg_structuring,0
"To prevent this behavior, the paper proposes to combine multiple Bayesian neural networks, independently trained with Dropout MC, to an ensemble.",,arg_structuring,0
The proposed method achieves better uncertainty estimates than a single Bayesian neural networks model and improves upon the baseline in an active learning setting for image classification.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper addresses active deep learning which is certainly an interesting research direction since in practice, labeled data is notoriously scarce.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the paper contains only little novelty and does not provide sufficiently new scientific insights.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is well known from the literature that combining multiply neural networks to an ensemble leads to better performance and uncertainty estimates.,,arg_fact,0
"For instance, Lakshminarayanan et al.[1] showed that Dropout MC can produce overconfident wrong prediction and, by simply averaging prediction over multiple models, one achieves better performance and confidence scores.",,arg_fact,0
"Also, Huand et al. [2] showed that by taking different snapshots of the same network at different timesteps performance improves.",,arg_fact,0
"It would also be great if the paper could related to other existing work that uses Bayesian neural networks in an active learning setting such as Bayesian optimization [3, 4] or Bandits[5].",,arg_request,1
Another weakness of the paper is that the empirical evaluation is not sufficiently rigorous:,,arg_evaluative,0
"1) Besides an comparison to the work by Lakshminarayanan et. al, I would also like to have seen a comparison to other existing Bayesian neural network approaches such as stochastic gradient Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods.",,arg_request,1
"2) To provide a better understanding of the paper, it would also be interesting to see how sensitive it is with respect to the ensemble size M.",,arg_request,1
"3) Furthermore, for the experiments only one neural network architecture was considered and it remains an open question, how the presented results translate to other architectures.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The same holds for the type of data, since the paper only shows results for image classification benchmarks.",,arg_evaluative,0

This paper proposes an approach for mitigating issues associated with high-frequency/amplitude control signals that may be obtained when one applies reinforcement learning algorithms to continuous control tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
"The approach taken by the paper is to solve a constrained optimization problem, where the constraint imposes a (potentially state-dependent) lower bound on the reward.",,arg_structuring,0
This is done by using a Lagrangian relaxation that learns the parameters of a control policy that satisfies the desired constraints (and also learns the Lagrange multipliers).,,arg_structuring,0
The presented approach is demonstrated on a cart-pole swing-up task as well as a quadruped locomotion task.,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
+ The paper is generally clear and readable.,,arg_evaluative,0
+ The simulation results for the Minitaur quadruped robot are performed using a realistic model of the robot.,,arg_evaluative,0
Major concern:,,arg_structuring,0
- My biggest concern is that the technical contributions of the paper are not clear at all.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The motivation for the work (avoiding high amplitude/frequency control inputs) is certainly now new; this has always been a concern of control theorists and roboticists (e.g., when considering minimum-time optimal control problems, or control schemes such as sliding mode control).",,arg_evaluative,0
The idea of using a constrained formulation is not novel either (constrained MDPs have been thoroughly studied since Altman (1999)).,,arg_evaluative,0
"The technical approach of using a Lagrangian relaxation is the standard way one goes about handling constrained optimization problems, and thus I do not see any novelty there either.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall, the paper does not make a compelling case for the novelty of the problem or approach.",,arg_evaluative,0
Other concerns:,,arg_structuring,0
"- For the cart-pole task, the paper states that the reward is modified ""to exclude any cost objective"".",,arg_fact,0
Results are then presented for this modified reward showing that it results in high-frequency control signals (and that the proposed constrained approach avoids this).,,arg_fact,0
I don't think this is really a fair comparison; I would have liked to have seen results for the unmodified reward function.,,arg_evaluative,0
- The claim made in the first line of the abstract (applying RL algorithms to continuous control problems often leads to bang-bang control),,arg_evaluative,0
is very broad and should be watered down.,,none,0
This is the case only when one considers a poorly-designed cost function that doesn't take into account realistic factors such as actuator limits.,,none,0
"- In the last paragraph of Section 3.3, the paper proposes making the lower-bound on the reward state-dependent.",,arg_fact,0
"However, this can be tricky in practice since it requires having an estimate for Q_r(s,a) as a function of the state (in order to ensure that the state-dependent lower bound can indeed be satisfied).",,arg_evaluative,0

This paper formulates a new inference method called DDGC for noise labels and adversarial attacks.,,arg_structuring,0
Their main idea is to induce a generative classifer on top of hidden feature spaces of the discriminative deep model.,,arg_structuring,0
"To improve the robustness, their DDGC model leverages the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator.",,arg_structuring,0
"Besides, the author proposes Theorem 1 to justify their MCD-based generative classifer.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
1. The authors find a new angle for learning with noisy labels.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Motivated by the fact that LDA-like generative classifer assuming the class-wise unimodal distribution might be robust, they introduce a generative classifer on top of hidden feature spaces of the discriminative deep model.",,arg_structuring,0
2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework in benchmark datasets. And their experimental result support their previous claims.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
We have two questions in the following.,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Related works: In deep learning with noisy labels, there are three main directions, including small-loss trick [1-3], estimating noise transition matrix [4-6], and explicit and implicit regularization [7-9].",,arg_fact,0
I would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines in their paper instead of listing some basic ones.,,arg_request,1
2. Experiment:,,arg_structuring,0
"2.1 Baselines: For noisy labels, the authors should add MentorNet [1] as a baseline https://github.com/google/mentornet From my own experience, this baseline is very strong.",,arg_request,1
"At the same time, they should compare with VAT [7].",,arg_request,1
"For adversarial attacks, the author should compare with data type from [10], and list L-FBGS [11] as a basic baseline.",,arg_request,1
"2.2 Datasets: For datasets, I think the author should first compare their methods on symmetric and aysmmetric noisy data.",,arg_request,1
"Besides, the current paper only verifies on vision datasets.",,arg_fact,0
The authors are encouraged to conduct 1 NLP dataset.,,arg_request,1

## Summary ##,,arg_structuring,0
The authors apply policy gradients to combinatorial optimization problems.,,arg_structuring,0
"They suggest a surrogate reward function that mitigates the variance in the reward, and hence the update size.",,arg_structuring,0
They demonstrate performance on a clique-finding problem.,,arg_structuring,0
## Assessment ##,,arg_structuring,0
I don't think Cakewalk is different enough from the cross-entropy method to warrant acceptance in ICLR.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I also have concerns about the independence assumption in their sampling distribution (Section 3.2), and the fact that their experiments use the same set of (untuned) hyperparameters for each method.",,arg_evaluative,0
They both approximate the reward CDF from K samples and use this to construct a surrogate reward.,,arg_fact,0
"The difference is that Cakewalk uses the CDF directly, while CE uses a threshold function on the CDF.",,arg_fact,0
## Specific Comments and Questions ##,,arg_structuring,0
1. Cakewalk is *very* closely related to the cross-entropy method.,,arg_fact,0
"The authors acknowledge this connection, but I think they should begin by introducing CE and then explain how Cakewalk generalizes it.",,arg_request,1
Both Cakewalk and CE approximate the reward CDF from K samples and use this to construct a surrogate reward.,,arg_fact,0
"The difference is that Cakewalk uses the CDF directly, while CE uses a threshold function on the CDF.",,arg_fact,0
2. The distribution proposed in section 3.2 assumes independence between the elements $x_j$. This seems problematic for some relatively simple problems.,,arg_evaluative,0
Consider $x$ a binary vector and reward equal to the parity $S(x) = \sum{x_j} % 2$.,,arg_other,0
"3. In the experiments, there are large discrepancies between different optimizers on Cakewalk (e.g. SGA vs AdaGrad, Table 4).",,arg_evaluative,0
Is there any explanation for this?,,arg_request,1
"4. How were the hyperparameters (learning rate, AdaGrad $\delta$, Adam $\beta_1, \beta_2$) chosen?",,arg_request,1
"It seems like a large assumption that the same learning rate would work for different methods, especially when some of them are normalizing the objective function.",,arg_evaluative,0
I would suggest tuning these values for each method independently.,,arg_request,1
5. It would be nice to see experimental results on more than one problem.,,arg_request,1
"The authors discuss their results on k-medoids in the appendices, but it seems like these results aren't quite complete yet.",,arg_evaluative,0
"6. In Table 3, the figure in bold is not the lowest (best) in the table.",,arg_structuring,0
"The reason for this is only given in a single sentence at the end of Section 6, so it is a little confusing.",,arg_request,1
I would replace these values with N/A or something similar.,,arg_request,1
"This work extends Schlichtkrull et al. (2018) by adding attention in two distinct ways: attention between pairs of nodes per relation, and attention between pairs of nodes averaged over all relations.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is well written and the equations easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The results are not strong. And, unfortunately, the model contribution currently is too modest.",,arg_evaluative,0
Inductive task results: Wu et al. (2018) reports that for Tox21 (Duvenauld et al. 2015) is the best-performing approach.,,arg_evaluative,0
"We should see the performance on other datasets  (e.g., some of the other datasets in Wu et al. (2018)).",,arg_request,1
My introduction suggestion: do not talk about Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). There is a *lot* of work on graph convolutional networks (GCNs).,,arg_request,1
"Reading it feels like reading about lattices when the work is about general graphs, and lattices provide no intuition about the proposed solution.",,arg_evaluative,0
--- After rebuttal ---,,arg_structuring,0
Still not convinced of the value of the work to the community. Will keep my score the same.,,arg_evaluative,0
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
The authors propose using non-Euclidean spaces for GCNs.,,arg_structuring,0
"This is inspired by the recent work into non-Euclidean, and especially hyperbolic, embeddings.",,arg_structuring,0
"A few papers have recently tried to go past embeddings into building non-Euclidean models, requiring the lifting of standard operations in Euclidean space to non-Euclidean settings.",,arg_structuring,0
"This has been done in particular in hyperbolic space, but some datasets benefit from more complex spaces.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors combine the mixed-curvature product formalism that uses products of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces for embeddings, but use these for GCN operations.",,arg_structuring,0
"Doing this requires, in particular, developing a reasonable way to perform these operations in spherical space (since Euclidean is trivial and hyperbolic has been recently worked on).",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors do a nice lifting via complex operations, and both the hyperbolic and spherical spaces can devolve into the flat Euclidean space when their curvature goes to 0.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors implement these GCNs, train the curvatures, and demonstrate performance improvements over Euclidean only versions on node classification on benchmark datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
They also give a fairly nice introduction to all of these ideas in an extended appendix.,,arg_structuring,0
"Strengths, Weaknesses, Recommendation:",,arg_structuring,0
"This paper is reasonably interesting---it joins an effort to produce non-Euclidean models in a tractable way, which is fairly challenging, but could have a good impact.",,arg_evaluative,0
"On the plus side, it's great that the authors added the nice development for the spherical operations, since that will come in handy for many models.",,arg_evaluative,0
The experiments are also good.,,arg_evaluative,0
"On the downside, everything here is an extension of existing work, and the body of the paper is hard to read (though this may be inevitable, there's a lot of background to go over here).",,arg_evaluative,0
Overall I recommend accepting it; I think it's a solid contribution.,,arg_evaluative,0
Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
"- I don't understand why the authors say that their space ""interpolates smoothly"" just because the limit in the curvature is the same from the left and right side.",,arg_request,1
"For example, the absolute value function has the same limit from the left and the right at 0, but it's not differentiable there. Is it actually true that if we take the derivatives of the piecewise hyperbolic/spherical distance function that it's differentiable at c=0?",,arg_request,1
"- There are a couple of recent papers that also consider hyperbolic GCNs, and in fact use  similar ideas for the aggregation and update steps (i.e., same lift to hyperbolic space).",,arg_fact,0
"However, these were recently NeurIPS papers, and the text is not yet out, so I don't think this should affect the authors' independent work (and also the product part is new).",,arg_fact,0
I do recommend that the authors compare against those results in a future update of this work.,,arg_request,1
"The papers are ""Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"" by Chami et al and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks by Liu et al.",,arg_fact,0
- One thing that I didn't see discussed by the authors is that there are subtle difference between hyperbolic and spherical spaces.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, the weighted midpoint of Def. 3.2 doesn't immediately extend to spherical space (or at least won't be unique).",,arg_evaluative,0
"As an example, consider S^2 and the mean of two antipodal points on it---there's many choices for the midpoint.",,arg_fact,0
You probably have to limit the operation to a half-sphere (there's some ideas for this in Gu et al).,,arg_request,1
"- For the synthetic tree, why is the number of edges 2(|V|-1) rather than |V|-1?",,arg_request,1
- Are the curvatures the same for each layer for the GCNs?,,arg_request,1
This is an interesting point to discuss (some of the NeurIPS papers I mentioned train the curvature for each layer).,,arg_request,1
"Also, how do you select the number of factors of each type?",,arg_request,1
"- Minor, but some of these citations can be updated.",,arg_structuring,0
"The ""De Sa"" et al 2018 arxiv citation is really Sala et al and is an ICML '18 paper.",,arg_request,1
"Similarly, Gulcehre et al is a 2019 ICLR paper, and so on. It's always good to get these right.",,arg_request,1
- Is there any actual empirical importance from recovering the Euclidean case exactly for 0 curvature?,,arg_request,1
The reason I ask is that my experience is that the hyperboloid is typically easier to work,,arg_fact,0
with,,none,0

"- One useful thing to point out in B.3.3 is that in general, it need not be a diffeomorphism for all of M for any manifold, which leads to non-uniqueness.",,arg_request,1
"In differential geometry, the ""cut locus"" is the region beyond which there is this non-uniqueness.",,arg_fact,0
"- In the appendix, the statement ""Sarkar (2011) show that a similar statement as in Theorem 2 holds for a very general class of trees"" is confusing to me. The ""general class"", as far as I know, is actually *all* trees, weighted or unweighted.",,arg_evaluative,0
The main contributions of this work are essentially on the theoretical aspects.,,arg_structuring,0
"It seems that the proposed algorithm is not very original because its two parts, namely prediction (coefficient estimation) and learning (dictionary update) have been widely used in the literature, using respectively a IHT and a gradient descent.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors need to describe in detail the algorithmic novelty of their work.,,arg_request,1
The definition of “recovering true factor exactly” need to be given.,,arg_request,1
"The proposed algorithm involves several tuning parameters, when alternating between two updating rules, an IHT-based update for coefficients and a gradient descent-based update for the dictionary.",,arg_fact,0
"Therefore, an appropriate choice of their values need to be given.",,arg_request,1
"In the algorithm, the authors need to define the HT function in (3) and (4).",,arg_request,1
"In the experiments, the authors compare the proposed method to only the one proposed by Arora et al. 2015.",,arg_structuring,0
"We think that this is not enough, and more extensive experimental results would provide a better paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
"There are some typos that can be easily found, such as “of the out algorithm”.",,arg_request,1
"This paper proposes an efficient zero-confidence attack algorithm, MARGINATTACK, which uses the modified Rosen's algorithm to optimize the same objective as CW attack.",,arg_structuring,0
"Under a set of conditions, the authors proved convergence of the proposed attack algorithm.",,arg_structuring,0
My main concern about this paper is why this algorithm has a better performance than CW attack?,,arg_request,1
I would suggest comparing with CW attack under different sets of hyper-parameters.,,arg_evaluative,0
Minor comment:,,arg_structuring,0
"The theoretical proof depends on the convexity assumption, I would also suggest comparing the proposed attack with CW and other benchmarks on some simple models that satisfy the assumptions.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper deals with the problem of recovering an exact solution for both the dictionary and the activation coefficients.,,arg_structuring,0
"As other works, the solution is based on a proper initialization of the dictionary.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors suggest using Aurora 2015 as a possible initialization.,,arg_structuring,0
The contribution improves Arora 2015 in that it converges linearly and recovers both the dictionary and the coefficients with no bias.,,arg_structuring,0
"The main contribution is the use of a IHT-based strategy to update the coefficients, with a gradient-based update for the dictionary (NOODL algorithm).",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors show that, combined with a proper initialization, this has exact recovery guaranties.",,arg_structuring,0
"Interestingly, their experiments show that NOODL converges linearly in number of iterations, while Arora gets stuck after some iterations.",,arg_structuring,0
I think the paper is relevant and proposes an interesting contribution.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is well written and the key elements are in the body.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, there is a lot of important material in the Appendix, which I think may be relevant to the readers.",,arg_fact,0
It would be nice to have some more intuitive explanations at least of Theorem 1.,,arg_request,1
"Also, it is clear in the experiments the superiority with respect to Arora in terms of iterations (and error), but what about computational time?",,arg_request,1
"This paper proposes using spectral normalization (SN) as a regularization for adversarial training, which is based on [Miyato et. al., ICLR 2018], where the original paper used SN for GAN training.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper also uses the results from [Neyshabur et. al., ICLR 2018], where the original paper provided generalization bounds that depends on spectral norm of each layer.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper is well written in general, the experiments are extensive.",,arg_structuring,0
"The idea of studying based on the combination of the results from two previous papers is quite natural, since one uses spectral normalization in practice for GAN training, and the other provides generalization bound that depends on spectral norm.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The novelty of the algorithm itself is limited, since GAN and adversarial training are both minmax problems, and the original algorithm can be carried over easily.",,arg_evaluative,0
The experimental result itself is quite comprehensive.,,arg_evaluative,0
"On the other hand, this paper provides specific generalization bounds under three adversarial attack methods, which explains the power of SN under those settings.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, it is not clear to me that these are some novel results that can better help adversarial training.",,arg_request,1
"Though rather dense in its exposition, this paper is an interesting contribution to the area of self-supervised learning  based on discrete representations.",,arg_evaluative,0
What would make it stronger imo is to address the issue of how much is gained from a discrete vs. continuous representation.,,arg_request,1
The authors take it as a given that discrete is good because it allows us to leverage work in NLP.,,arg_structuring,0
That makes sense -- but at what cost?,,arg_request,1
"""Table 4 shows that our first results are promising, even though they are not as good as the state of the art."" The state of the art on LibriSpeech is not Mohamed at al. 2019. See e.g. Irie et al. Interspeech 2019 for better result",,arg_evaluative,0
"The Conclusion is very sparse. ""In future work, we are planning to apply other algorithms requiring discrete inputs to audio data"":",,arg_structuring,0
can  you elaborate?,,arg_request,1
"The authors propose a method for image restoration, where the restored image is the MAP estimate.",,arg_structuring,0
A pretrained GAN is utilized to approximate the prior distribution of the noise-free images.,,arg_structuring,0
"Then, the likelihood induces a constraint which is based on the degradation function.",,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, the method tries to find the latent point for which the GAN generates the image, which if gets degraded will match the given degraded image.",,arg_structuring,0
"Also, an optimization algorithm is presented that solves the proposed constrained optimization problem.",,arg_evaluative,0
I find the paper very well written and easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, the idea is pretty clean, and the derivations are simple and clear.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Additionally, the Figures 2,3 are very intuitive and nicely explain the theory.",,arg_evaluative,0

"#1) I do not understand exactly what the ""general method"" means. Does it mean that you propose a method, where you can just change the F, such that to solve a different degradation problem? So you provide the general framework where somebody has to specify only the F?",,arg_request,1

"#4) I think that the function F has to be differentiable, and this should be mentioned in the text.",,arg_request,1
"Also, I believe that some actual (analytic) examples of F should be provided, at least  in the experiments.",,arg_request,1
The same holds for the p(Omega).,,arg_request,1
This parameter Omega is estimated individually for each degraded image?,,arg_request,1

"#6) I believe that it would be nice to include a magnified image of Fig. 3, where the gradient steps are shown.",,arg_request,1
"Also, my understanding is that the optimization goal is to find first a feasible solution, and then find the point that maximizes f. I think that this can be clarified in the text.",,arg_request,1
"#7) The optimization steps seem to be intuitive, however, there is not any actual proof of converge.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Of course, the example in the Figure 3 is very nice and intuitive, but it is also rather simple.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I would suggest, at least, to include some empirical evidences in the experiments that show convergence.",,arg_request,1
#8) In the experiments I think that at least one example of F and p(Omega) should be presented.,,arg_request,1

The authors have collected the dataset themselves and have rating of sets of 3 objects from 1854 unique objects.,,arg_structuring,0
They end up with a space (SPoSE) with relatively low dimensionality with respect to usual word embeddings (49 dimension) but perhaps not surprising when considering the small size of the words to embed.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors run a set of experiment to show the usefulness of SPoSE.,,arg_structuring,0
"The most interesting one is the prediction of its dimensions by the CSLB features, which reveals a nice clustering in the different SPoSE dimensions.",,arg_structuring,0
Perhaps the results would be a little more convincing if additional common word embeddings were also tested.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Due to the different objects used in the different datasets, some of the experiments have a smaller set of words.",,arg_evaluative,0
A good extension of this work would be to combine a text-derived embedding  or the synsets to interpolate the SPoSE dimensions for missing words in the original set.,,arg_request,1
Or perhaps the object similarity ratings could be used in a semi-supervised setting to inform the learning of a co-occurence word embedding.,,arg_request,1
This will allow the model to better describe a larger set of words.,,arg_request,1
Another possible extension is to test this larger set of words on a non-behavioral NLP task to show possible improvements that the behavioral data and the interpretable space give.,,arg_request,1

"The paper builds upon Deep Image Prior (DIP) - work which shows that one can optimize a neural generator to fit a single image without learning on any dataset, and the output of the generator (which approximates the image) can be used for denoising / super resolution / etc.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper proposes a new architecture for the DIP method which has much less parameters, but works on par with DIP.",,arg_structuring,0
Another contribution of the paper is theoretical treatment of (a simplified version of) the proposed architecture showing that it can’t fit random noise (and thus maybe better suited for denoising).,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper is clearly written, and the proposed architecture has too cool properties: it’s compact enough to be used for image compression; and it doesn’t overfit thus making early stopping notnesesary (which was crucial for the original DIP model).",,arg_evaluative,0
I have two main concerns about this paper.,,arg_structuring,0
"First, it is somewhat misleading about its contributions: it's not obvious from abstract/introduction that the whole model is the same as DIP except for the proposed architecture.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Specifically, the first contribution listed in the introduction makes it look like this paper introduces the idea of not learning the decoder on the dataset (the one that starts with “The network is not learned and itself incorporates all assumptions on the data.”).",,arg_evaluative,0
My second concern is about the theoretical contribution.,,arg_structuring,0
"On the one hand, I enjoyed the angle the authors tackled proving that the network architecture is underparameterized enough to be a good model for denoising.",,arg_evaluative,0
"On the other hand, the obtained results are very weak: only one layered version of the paper is analysed and the theorem applies only to networks with less than some threshold of parameters.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Roughly, the theorem states that if for example we fix any matrix B of size e.g. 256 x k and matrix U of size 512 x 256 and then compute U relu(B C) where C is the vector of parameters of size k x 1, AND if k < 2.5 (i.e. if we use at most 2 parameters), then it would be very hard to fit 512 iid gaussian values (i.e. min_C ||U relu(B C) - eta|| where eta ~ N(0, 1)).",,arg_evaluative,0
"This restriction of the number of parameters to be small is only mentioned in the theorem itself, not in the discussion of its implications.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, the theorem only applies to the iid noise, while most natural noise patterns have structure (e.g. JPEG artifacts, broken pixels, etc) and thus can probably be better approximated with deep models.",,arg_fact,0
"Since the paper manages to use very few parameters (BTW, how many parameters in total do you have? Can you please add this number to the text?), it would be cool to see if second order methods like LBFGS can be applied here.",,arg_request,1
Some less important points:,,arg_structuring,0
Fig 4 is very confusing.,,arg_evaluative,0
"First, it doesn’t label the X axis.",,arg_request,1
"Second, the caption mentions that early stopping is beneficial for the proposed method, but I can’t see it from the figure.",,arg_request,1
"Third, I don’t get what is plotted on different subplots.",,arg_request,1
"The text mentions that (a) is fitting the noisy image, (b) is fitting the noiseless image, and (c) is fitting noise. Is it all done independently with three different models?",,arg_request,1
"Then why does the figure says test and train loss? And why DIP loss goes up, it should be able to fit anything, right? If not and it’s a single model that gets fitted on the noisy image and tested on the noiseless image, then how can you estimate the level of noise fitting? ||G(C) - eta|| should be high if G(C) ~= x.",,arg_request,1
"Also, in this quote “In Fig. 4(a) we plot the Mean Squared Error (MSE) over the number of iterations of the optimizer for fitting the noisy astronaut image x + η (i.e., FORMULA ...” the formula doesn’t correspond to the text.",,arg_request,1
"And finally, the discussion of this figure makes claims about the behaviour of the model that seems to be too strong to be based on a single image experiment.",,arg_evaluative,0
I don’t get the details of the batch normalization used: with respect to which axis the mean and variance are computed?,,arg_request,1
The authors claim that the model is not convolutional.,,arg_fact,0
"But first, it’s not obvious why this would be a good thing (or a bad thing for that matter)",,arg_request,1

"Second, it’s not exactly correct (as noted in the paper itself): the architecture uses 1x1 convolutions and upsampling, which combined give a weak and underparametrized analog of convolutions.",,arg_evaluative,0
"> The deep decoder is a deep image model G: R N → R n, where N is the number of parameters of the model, and n is the output dimension, which is typically much larger than the number of parameters (N << n).",,arg_fact,0

"It would be nice to have a version of Figure 6 with k = 6, so that one can see all feature maps (in contrast to a subset of them).",,arg_request,1

Choquet Integral is used to deal with set input.,,arg_structuring,0

This paper studies backdoor attacks under federated learning setting.,,arg_structuring,0
"To inject a certain backdoor pattern, existing work generate poisoning samples by blending the same pattern with different input samples.",,arg_structuring,0
"Even for federated learning where the adversary can control multiple parties, such as [1], all parties still use the same global backdoor pattern to generate poisoning samples locally.",,arg_structuring,0
"On the contrary, in this work, they decompose the global pattern into several small local patterns, and each adversarial party only uses a local pattern to generate poisoning samples.",,arg_structuring,0
"In their evaluation, they show that the backdoor attacks generated in this way are more effective, resilient to benign model parameter updates, and also survive better against existing defense algorithms against attacks in federated learning settings.",,arg_structuring,0
"I think the topic studied in this paper is very important and meaningful, and I am convinced that by decomposing a global pattern into several smaller local pieces, the model parameter updates computed by each party should be more similar to benign updates and thus can better bypass the defense algorithms.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Meanwhile, the evaluation is pretty comprehensive and it is good to see that the conducted backdoor attacks are effective.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, when there is no defense deployed in the training process, it is not intuitive to see why the proposed attack is more effective and persistent than the centralized attack, given that a smaller trigger usually results in a worse attack performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Thus, I would like to see more possible explanation on it.",,arg_request,1
"Specifically, I have the following questions for clarification:",,arg_structuring,0
"1. For the evaluation of DBA, I assume that there are 4 adversarial parties, controlling each of the 4 local triggers. When using centralized attacks, are there still 4 adversarial parties, although they share the same global trigger, or if there is only 1 adversarial party?",,arg_request,1
"2. To evaluate A-S setting, I understand that it may be tricky to enable a fair comparison between the centralized attack and DBA.",,arg_fact,0
"However, one explanation of why DBA is more persistent in this case is because the adversarial parameter updates happen 4x times compared to the centralized attack.",,arg_fact,0
"Therefore, another baseline to check is to conduct centralized attacks with the same number of times as DBA, but each update includes 1/4 number of poisoning samples, so that the total number of poisoning samples included to compute the gradient update still stays the same.",,arg_fact,0
3. Can the authors show if the decomposition is also useful for trigger patterns that are not necessarily regular shapes?,,arg_request,1
"For backdoor attacks, a line of work studies physical triggers, e.g., glasses in [2].",,arg_fact,0
"It is not natural to decompose such kind of patterns into several smaller pieces, unless the performance is significantly boosted.",,arg_evaluative,0
4. Can the authors show concrete examples on how the attacks are generated?,,arg_request,1

"Decision: despite the seeming unfair comparison, this task is novel. I vote for weak accept.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposed variational selective autoencoders (VSAE) to learn from partially-observed multimodal data.,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, the proposed method is elegant; however, the presentation, the claim, and the experiments suffer from significant flaws.",,arg_evaluative,0
See below for detailed comments.,,arg_structuring,0
[Pros],,arg_structuring,0
1. The main idea of the paper is to propose a generative model that can handle partially-observed multimodal data during training.,,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, prior work considered non-missing data during training, while we can't always guarantee that all the modalities are available.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Especially in the field of multimodal learning, we often face the issue of imperfect sensors.",,arg_fact,0
This line of work should be encouraged.,,arg_fact,0
"2. In my opinion, the idea is elegant.",,arg_evaluative,0
The way the author handles the missingness is by introducing an auxiliary binary random variable (the mask) for it.,,arg_structuring,0
"Nevertheless, its presentation and Figure 1 makes this elegant idea seems over-complicated.",,arg_evaluative,0
[Cons],,arg_structuring,0
1. [The claim] One of my concerns for this paper is the assumption of the factorized latent variables from multimodal data.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Specifically, the author mentioned Tsai et al. assumed factorized latent variables from the multimodal data, while Tsai et al. actually assumed the generation of multimodal data consists of disentangled modality-specific and multimodal factors.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It seems to me; the author assumed data from one modality is generated by all the latent factors (see Eq. (11)), then what is the point for assuming the prior of the latent factor is factorized (see Eq. (4) and (5))?",,arg_request,1
"One possible explanation is because we want to handle the partially-observable issues from multimodal data, and it would be easier to make the latent factors factorized (see Eq. (6)).",,arg_fact,0
The author should comment on this.,,arg_request,1
2. [Phrasing.] There are too many unconcise or informal phrases in the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, I don't understand what does it mean in ""However, if training data is complete, ..... handle during missing data during test."" Another example would be the last few paragraphs on page 4; they are very unclear.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, the author should avoid using the word ""simply"" too often (see the last few paragraphs on page 5).",,arg_request,1
3. [Presentation.] The presentation is undesirable. It may make the readers hard to follow the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
I list some instances here.,,arg_structuring,0
"a. In Eq. (3), it surprises me to see the symbol \epsilon without any explanation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"b. In Eq. (6), it also surprises me to see no description of \phi and \psi.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The author should also add more explanation here,",,arg_request,1
since Eq. (6)  stands a crucial role in the author's method.,,none,0
c. Figure 1 is over-complicated.,,arg_evaluative,0
d. What is the metric in Table 1 and 2?,,arg_request,1
"The author never explains. E.g., link to NRMSE and PFC to the Table.",,arg_evaluative,0
e. What are the two modalities in Table 2? The author should explain.,,arg_request,1
f. The author completely moved the results of MNIST-SVHN to Supplementary.,,arg_fact,0
"It is fine, but it seems weird that the author still mentioned the setup of MNIST+SVHN in the main text.",,arg_evaluative,0
"g. The author mentioned, in Table , the last two rows serve the upper bound for other methods.",,arg_fact,0
While some results are even better than the last two rows.,,arg_fact,0
The author should explain this.,,arg_request,1
"h. Generally speaking, the paper does require a significant effort to polish Section 3 and 4.",,arg_evaluative,0
"4. [Experiments.] The author presented a multimodal representation learning framework for partially-observable multimodal data, while the experiments cannot corraborrate the claim.",,arg_evaluative,0
"First, I consider the tabular features as multi-feature data and less to be the multimodal data.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Second, the synthetic image pairs are not multimodal in nature.",,arg_evaluative,0
"These synthetic setting can be used for sanity check, but cannot be the main part of the experiments.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The author can perhaps consider the datasets used by Tsai et al. There are seven datasets, and they can all be modified to the setting of partially-observable multimodal data.",,arg_request,1
"Also, since the synthetic image pairs are not multimodal in nature, it is unclear to me for what the messages are conveyed in Figure 3 and 4.",,arg_evaluative,0
I do expect the paper be a strong submission after a significant effort in presentation and experimental designs.,,arg_social,0
"Therefore, I vote for weak rejection at this moment.",,arg_other,0
The authors argue that not knowing the distribution of rewards observed in the policy gradient algorithm hinders learning (and the tuning process).,,arg_structuring,0
"They propose to replace the reward term in the policy gradient algorithm with its centered empirical cumulative distribution, which has a fixed and known U[-1, 1] distribution.",,arg_structuring,0
"They test their methods on a toy task that consists in finding inclusion maximal cliques (which tests for local optimality) against REINFORCE (including their variants: centering the rewards with a mean baseline or normalizing them), the cross-entropy method and Exp3.",,arg_structuring,0
I think that the current draft lacks strong experimental results to properly demonstrate the usefulness of the method.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The method is only evaluated on a single task and many confounding variables (the design of the reward function, factorizing the parametric distribution into marginals, reporting results for a single (non-tuned?) learning rate, etc.) make evaluation difficult.",,arg_evaluative,0
The usefulness of the approach is also lessened by the greater importance of the choice of the optimizer.,,arg_evaluative,0
I would like the method to be applied on other domains such as continuous non-convex optimization and reinforcement learning.,,arg_request,1
"Additionally, I find the motivation for caring about local optimality unconvincing.",,arg_evaluative,0
I take exception that people care more about local optimality than the actual objective.,,arg_fact,0
"From a practical point of view, local optimality is a mean (that can be achieved via heuristic algorithms) to an end (the objective itself).",,arg_fact,0
"This also holds for k-means, which is usually run multiple times with different starting conditions.",,arg_fact,0
Some comments:,,arg_structuring,0
- Table 3 is a bit confusing as-is (lower is only better when controlling on the quality of the best sample.,,arg_evaluative,0
e.g: REINFORCE has lower best-sample to total-sample ratio but its solutions are worse),,arg_evaluative,0
- It isn't clear from the tables that OCE_0.1 outperforms REINFORCE_Z (as is mentioned in the discussion).,,arg_evaluative,0
"- The paper should refer to 1) the reward shaping literature, 2) the growing line of works concerned with control variates for REINFORCE (such as VIMCO, MuProp, REBAR) and 3) the growing line of works concerned about combinatorial optimization with reinforcement learning (Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning, etc.)",,arg_request,1
- I would also encourage the authors to come up with a more descriptive name for the approach.,,arg_request,1
This paper provides a new dynamic perspective on deep neural network.,,arg_structuring,0
"Based on Gaussian weights and biases, the paper investigates the evolution of the covariance matrix along with the layers.",,arg_structuring,0
"Eventually the matrices achieve a stationary point, i.e., fixed point of the dynamic system.",,arg_structuring,0
Local performance around the fixed point is explored.,,arg_structuring,0
Extensions are provided to include the batch normalization.,,arg_structuring,0
I believe this paper may stimulate some interesting ideas for other researchers.,,arg_evaluative,0
Two technical questions:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. When the layers tends to infinity, the covariance matrix reaches stationary (fixed) point.",,arg_fact,0
How to understand this phenomenon? Does this mean that the distribution of the layer outputs will not change too much if the layer is deep enough?,,arg_request,1
"This somewhat conflicts the commonsense of ""the deeper the better?""",,arg_evaluative,0
"2. Typos: the weight matrix in the end of page 2 should be N_l times N_{l-1}. Also, the x_i's in the first line of page 3 should be bold.",,arg_request,1
This paper presents a new method to measure the importance of hidden neurons in deep neural networks.,,arg_structuring,0
"The method integrates notions of activation value, input influence to a neuron and neuron influence to the network's output.",,arg_structuring,0
They provide results confirming that this measure is able to identify neurons that are important for specific tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
Quality,,arg_structuring,0
"The experiments are well designed to verify their hypothesis, although there could be more to make sure those results are not particular to the few selected problems.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Nevertheless, the results are consistent across those experiments.",,arg_evaluative,0
Clarity,,arg_structuring,0
"The text is well written in general, but the structure could be improved.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The introduction contains too much related work, which should be divided in another section.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Section 2 contains mostly high level explanations of the work, which should be integrated in the introduction, and thus before the related work section, to improve readability.",,arg_request,1
See minor comments for more specific suggestions.,,arg_structuring,0
It is difficult to understand the goal of Section 4.2.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Section 2 states that section 4.2 proves that a ""path method"" must be used in order to satisfy the axioms, but why such axioms are important is not stressed enough.",,arg_request,1
"Also, it is not clear why those are called axioms since they are not use to build anything else.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It seems to me that those are rather ""desirable properties"" than axioms.",,arg_evaluative,0
Originality,,arg_structuring,0
A important number of related works are cited and compared with the current work.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Although the proposed measure is close to what is proposed by Datta et al., this paper makes the distinction clear and benchmarks its results properly against it.",,arg_evaluative,0
Significance,,arg_structuring,0
There is an increasing need to interpretability of deep neural networks as they get more and more applied to real-world problems.,,arg_evaluative,0
Measures as the one proposed in this paper are a very important building block towards this.,,arg_evaluative,0
Conclusion,,arg_structuring,0
"For its original importance measure and the proper experiment benchmarks, I believe this paper should be accepted.",,arg_evaluative,0
There is however many minor issues that should be fixed for the camera-ready version.,,arg_request,1
"Although the recommended length is 8 pages, the strict limit is 10, so I would recommended to use a bit of the remaining extra space to conclude the paper properly with a discussion on the results and their consequences, as well as a conclusion to wrap up the paper.",,arg_request,1

Some explanations should be devoted to it.,,arg_request,1
- Second paragraph of remark 1 is not clear.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Why couldn't we take another layer's neuron as the neuron of interest, bounding the conductance measure on one layer as the input and the output of the model?

- Footnote 2 on page 5 it difficult to read.,,arg_request,1

This paper presented a relational graph attention networks that could consider both node,,arg_structuring,0

The basic idea is to combine the graph attention networks (Veličković et,,arg_structuring,0

and,,none,0
the relational graph networks (Schlichtkrull et al. 2018) to derive a hybrid,,none,0

This paper is generally easy to follow and written clearly.,,arg_evaluative,0

Although some promising,,arg_evaluative,0

i) The proposed architecture is mainly adopted from the graph attention networks (Veličković,,arg_fact,0

the relational graph networks (Schlichtkrull et al. 2018).,,none,0

Brief summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper presents a deep decoder model which given a target natural image and a random noise tensor learns to decode the noise tensor into the target image by a series of 1x1 convolutions, RELUs, layer wise normalizations and upsampling.",,arg_structuring,0
"The parameter of the convolution are fitted to each target image, where the source noise tensor is fixed.",,arg_structuring,0
The method is shown to serve as a good model for natural image for a variety of image processing tasks such as denoising and compression.,,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
* an interesting model which is quite intriguing in its simplicity.,,arg_evaluative,0
* good results and good analysis of the model,,arg_evaluative,0
* mostly clear writing and presentation (few typos etc. nothing too serious).,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons and comments:,,arg_structuring,0
* The author say explicitly that this is not a convolutional model because of the use of 1x1 convolutions.,,arg_fact,0
I disagree and I actually think this is important for two reasons.,,arg_evaluative,0
"First, though these are 1x1 convolutions, because of the up-sampling operation and the layer wise normalizations the influence of each operation goes beyond the 1x1 support.",,arg_fact,0
"Furthermore, and more importantly is the weight sharing scheme induced by this - using convolutions is a very natural choice for natural images (no pun intended) due to the translation invariant statistics of natural images.",,arg_fact,0
I doubt this would have worked so well hadn't it been modeled this way (not to mention this allows a small number of parameters).,,arg_evaluative,0
* The upsampling analysis is interesting but it is only done on synthetic data - will the result hold for natural images as well? should be easy to try and will allow a better understanding of this choice.,,arg_request,1
Natural images are only approximately piece-wise smooth after all.,,arg_fact,0
"* The use of the name ""batch-norm"" for the layer wise normalization is both wrong and misleading.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This is just channel-wise normalization with some extra parameters - no need to call it this way (even if it's implemented with the same function) as there is no ""batch"".",,arg_request,1
* I would have loved to see actual analysis of the method's performance as a function of the noise standard deviation.,,arg_request,1
"Specifically, for a fixed k, how would performance increase or decrease, and vice versa - for a given noise level, how would k affect performance.",,arg_request,1
* The actual standard deviation of the noise is not mentioned in any of the experiments (as far as I could tell),,arg_request,1
* What does the decoder produce when taking a trained C on a given image and changing the source noise tensor?,,arg_request,1
"I think that would shed light on what structures are learned and how they propagated in the image, possibly more than Figure 6 (which should really have something to compare to because it's not very informative out of context).",,arg_request,1
"This paper aims to estimate time-delayed, nonlinear causal influences from time series under the causal sufficiency assumption.",,arg_structuring,0
It is easy to follow and contains a lot of empirical results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Thanks for the results, but I have several questions.",,arg_structuring,0
"First, In Theorem 2, which seems to be a main result of the paper, the authors were concerned with the condition when W_{ji} >0, but there is not conclusion if W_{ji} =0.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In order to correctly estimate causal relations from data, both cases must be considered.",,arg_fact,0
"Second, the conclusion of Theorem 2 seems to be flawed.",,arg_evaluative,0
Let me try to make it clear with the following example.,,arg_structuring,0
"Suppose x^1_{t-2} directly causes x^2_{t-1} and that x^2_{t-1} directly causes x^3_{t}, without a direct influence from x^1_{t-2}  to x^3_{t}. Then when minimizing (2), we have the following results step by step:",,arg_other,0
"1) The noise standard deviation in x^2_{t-1}, denoted by \eta_2, may be non-zero.",,arg_other,0
"This is because we minimize a tradeoff of the prediction error (the first term in (2)) and a function of the reciprocal of the noise standard deviation \eta_2 (the second term in (2)), not only the prediction error.",,arg_fact,0
"2) If \eta_2 is non-zero, then x^1_{t-2} will be useful for the purpose of predicting x^3_{t}. (Note that if \eta_2 is zero, then x^1_{t-2} is not useful for predicting x^3_{t).) From the d-separation perspective, this is because x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not d-separated by x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, although they are d-separated by x^2_{t-1}. Then the causal Markov condition tells use that x^1_{t-2} and x^3_{t} are not independent conditional on x^2_{t-1} + \eta_2 \cdot \epsilon_2, which means that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}.",,arg_fact,0
"3) Given that x^1_{t-2} is useful for predicting x^3_{t}, when (2) is minimized, \eta_1 will not go to infinity, resulting in a non-zero W_{13), which *mistakenly* tells us that X^{1}_{t-1} directly structurally causes x^{(3)}_t.",,arg_fact,0
This illustrates that the conclusion of Theorem 2 may be wrong.,,arg_evaluative,0
I believe this is because the proof of Theorem 2 is flawed in lines 5-6 on Page 16.,,arg_fact,0
It does not seem sensible to drop X^{j}_{t-1} + \eta_X \cdot \epsilon_X and attain a smaller value of the cost function at the same time.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Please carefully check it, especially the argument given in lines 10-13.",,arg_fact,0
"Third, it is rather surprising that the authors didn't mention anything about the traditional causal discovery methods based on conditional independence relations in the data, known as constraint-based methods, such as the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 1993), IC algorithm (Pearl, 2000), and FCI (Spirtes et al., 1993).",,arg_evaluative,0
Such methods are directly applicable to time-delayed causal relations by further considering the constraint that effects temporally follow the causes.,,arg_fact,0
"Fourth, please make it clear that the proposed method aims to estimate ""causality-in-mean"" because of the formulation in terms of regression.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For instance, if x^j_{t-1} influences only the variance of x^i_{t}, but not its mean, then the proposed method may not detect such a causal influence, although the constraint-based methods can.",,arg_fact,0
Any response would be highly appreciated.,,arg_social,0
The paper proposed a hierarchical framework for problem embedding and intended to apply it to adaptive tutoring.,,arg_structuring,0
The system first used a rule-based method to extract the concepts for problems and then learned the concept embeddings and used them for problem representation.,,arg_structuring,0
"In addition, the paper further proposed negative pre-training for training with imbalanced data sets to decrease false negatives and positives.",,arg_structuring,0
The methods are compared with some other word-embedding based methods and showed 100% accuracy in a similarity detection test on a very small dataset.,,arg_structuring,0
"In sum, the paper has a very good application but not good enough as a research paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
Some of the problems are listed as follows:,,arg_structuring,0
1.	Lack of technical novelty.,,arg_evaluative,0
It seems to me just a combination of several mature techniques.,,arg_evaluative,0
I do not see much insight into the problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, if the rule-based concept extractor can already extract concepts very well, the “problem retrieval” should be solved by searching with the concepts as queries.",,arg_evaluative,0
Why should we use embedding to compare the similarity?,,arg_request,1
"Also, the title of the paper is about problem retrieval but the experiments are about similarity comparison, there seems a gap.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2.	Data size is too small, and the baselines",,arg_evaluative,0
are not state-of-the-art. There are some unsupervised sentence embedding methods other than the word-embedding based models.,,none,0
Some clarity issues.,,arg_structuring,0
"For example, Page 6. “is pre-trained on a pure set of negative samples”— what is the objective function? How to train on only negative samples?",,arg_request,1
*Summary*,,arg_structuring,0
This paper study the convergence of Hamiltonian gradient descent (HGD) on minmax games.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper show that under some assumption on the cost function of the min max that are (in some sense) weaker than strong convex-concavity.,,arg_structuring,0
"More precisely, they use the ‘bilinearity’ of the objective (due to the interaction between the players) to prove that the squared norm of the vector field of the game follows some Polyak Lojasiewicz condition.",,arg_structuring,0
Thus the proof is concluded by the linear (resp. sublinear) convergence of gradient descent (resp. stochastic GD) under PL assumption.,,arg_structuring,0
*Decision*,,arg_structuring,0
I think that is work is clearly very interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
The fact to prove linear convergence rate without strong-convex-concavity is quite surprising. And this paper brings nice tools to analyse HGD.,,arg_evaluative,0
Also the result on Stochastic HGD is very interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I am wondering whether this paper is perfectly suited to ICLR conference due to the lack of experiment, practical implication given by the theory, or theory in the non-convex setting (I know that the latter is a huge open question and I am not criticizing the absence of theory in the non-convex-concave setting).",,arg_evaluative,0
One way to improve to work would be to provide practical takeaways from the theory or to provide experiments in the main paper.,,arg_request,1
Regarding the practical limitation of this work:,,arg_structuring,0
- the sufficient bilinearity condition are hard to meet in practice. (even for convex-concave problems),,arg_fact,0
"- In a non-convex-concave setting, Hamiltonian gradient descent is attracted the any stationary point, even “local maxima” (or the equivalent in the minmax setting).",,arg_fact,0
Making this algorithm not very practical.,,arg_evaluative,0
"(However, CO is)",,none,0
"However, I really think that the community is currently lacking of understanding on minmax optimization and that we need better training method in many practical emergent frameworks that are minmax (such as GANs or multi agent learning). That is why, I would vote for a weak accept.",,arg_evaluative,0
*Questions*,,arg_structuring,0
- What are the practical implication of your work ? for instance does it say anything on how to tune $\gamma$ for CO ?,,arg_request,1
*Remarks*,,arg_structuring,0
- It is claimed that Theorem 3.4 gives the first linear convergence rate for minmax that does not require strong-convex or linearity.,,arg_structuring,0
"Note that, recently [1] seem to propose a result on extragradient in the same vein (i.e. without strong convexity or linearity).",,arg_fact,0
- (Minor) $\alpha$ not alway have the same unit: Thm 3.2 it is proportional to a strong convexity and in Lemma 4.7 it is proportional to a strong convexity squared (actually the PL of the squared norm of the gradient).,,arg_request,1
For clarity it might be interesting to use the notation $\alpha^2$ in Lemma 4.7.,,arg_request,1
The same way for unit consistency I would use $L_H^2$ instead of $L_H$,,arg_request,1

"Three popular self-supervised learning algorithms are then trained on this data sets, namely (Bi)GAN, RotNet, and DeepCluster, and the linear probing accuracy on different blocks is compared to that obtained by training the same methods on the reference data sets.",,arg_structuring,0
The linear probing accuracy from the first few conv layers of the network trained on the single/few image data set is found to be comparable to or better than that of the same model trained on the full reference data set.,,arg_structuring,0
I enjoyed the paper; it addresses the interesting setting of an extremely small data set which complements the large number of studies on scaling up self-supervised learning algorithms.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I think it is not extremely surprising that using the proposed strategy allows to learn low level features as captured by the first few layers, but I think it is worth studying and quantifying.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The experiments are carefully described and presented, and the paper is well-written.",,arg_evaluative,0
Here are a few questions and concerns:,,arg_structuring,0
- How much does the image matter for the single-image data set?,,arg_request,1
The selected images A and B are of very high entropy and show a lot of different objects (image A) and animals (image B). How do the results change if e.g. a landscape image or an abstract architecture photo is used?,,arg_request,1
"- How general is the proposed approach? How likely is it to generalize to other approaches such as Jigsaw (Doersch et al., 2015) and Exemplar (Dosovitskiy et al., 2016)? It would be good to comment on this.",,arg_request,1
"- [1] found that the network architecture for self-supervised learning can matter a lot, and that by using a ResNet architecture, performance of SSL methods can be significantly improved.",,arg_fact,0
"In particular, the linear probing accuracy appears to be often monotonic as a function of the depth of the layer it is computed from.",,arg_fact,0
"This is in contrast to what is observed for AlexNet in Tables 2 and 3, where the conv5 accuracy is lower than the conv4.",,arg_fact,0
It would therefore be instructive to add experiments for ResNet to see how well the results generalize to other network architectures.,,arg_request,1
"- Does the MonoGAN exhibit stable training dynamics comparable to training WGAN on CIFAR-10, or do the training dynamics change on the single-image data set?",,arg_request,1
"Overall, I’m leaning towards accepting the paper, but it would be important to see how well the experiments generalize to i) ResNet and ii) other (lower entropy) input images.",,arg_request,1

Update after rebuttal:,,arg_structuring,0
I thank the authors for their detailed response.,,arg_social,0
"I appreciate the efforts of the authors into investigating the issues raised, the described experiments sound promising.",,arg_social,0
"Unfortunately, the new results are not presented in the revision.",,arg_social,0
I will therefore keep my rating.,,arg_social,0
"This paper proposes a justification to one observation on VAE: ""restricting the family of variational approximations can, in fact, have a positive regularizing effect, leading to better generalization"".",,arg_structuring,0
The explanation given in this work is based on Gaussian mean-field approximation.,,arg_structuring,0
"I had trouble to understand some parts of this paper, since some of the sentences do not make sense to me. For example",,arg_evaluative,0
- the sentence under eq. (2),,arg_evaluative,0
"- the sentence ""Bacause the identity of the datapoint can never be learned by ..."" What is the identity of a dat point?",,arg_request,1
It looks like section 2.1 wants to show the connections between eq. (2) and other popularly used inference methods.,,arg_fact,0
"Somehow, those connections are not clear to me.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides some issues in the technical details, the major problem of this paper is that it uses the data processing inequality (DPI) in a **wrong** way.",,arg_evaluative,0
"As in (Cover and Thomas, 2012), which is also cited in this paper, DPI is defined on a Markov chain X -> Y -> Z and we have I(X,Y) >= I(X,Z).",,arg_fact,0
"However, based on the definition of \theta and \tilde{\theta} given in the first sentence of section 2.3, the relation between \theta, \tilde{\theta} and D",,arg_evaluative,0
should be: D <- \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if it is a generative model) or D -> \theta -> \tilde{\theta} (if a discriminative model).,,none,0
"Either case, I don't think we can have the inequality in eq. (5).",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper tackles the problem of semi-supervised classification using GAN-based models.,,arg_structuring,0
They proposed a manifold regularization by approximating the Laplacian norm using the stochastic finite difference.,,arg_structuring,0
The motivation is that making the classifier invariant to perturbations along the manifold is more reasonable than random perturbations.,,arg_structuring,0
The idea is to use GAN to learn the manifold.,,arg_structuring,0
The difficulty is that (the gradient of) Laplacian norm is impractical to compute for DNNs.,,arg_structuring,0
"They stated that another approximation of the manifold gradient, i.e. adding Gaussian noise \delta to z directly (||f(z) - f(g(z+\delta))||_F) has some drawbacks when the magnitude of noise is too large or too small.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors proposed another improved gradient approximation by first computing the normalized manifold gradient \bar r(z) and then adding a tunable magnitude of \bar r(z) to g(z), i.e., ||f(z) - f(g(z) +\epsilon \bar r(z) )||_F. Since several previous works Kumar et al. (2017) and Qi et al. (2018) also applied the idea of manifold regularization into GAN, the authors pointed out several advantages of their new regularization.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It gives some intuitive explanations of why their method works.,,arg_evaluative,0
- The idea is simple and easy to implement based on a standard GAN.,,arg_evaluative,0
- The authors conduct various experiments to show the interaction of the regularization and the generator.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"- For semi-supervised classification, the paper did not report the best results in other baselines.",,arg_evaluative,0
"E.g., in Table 1 and 2,  the best result of VAT (Miyato et al., 2017) is VAT+Ent, 13.15 for CIFAR-10 (4000 labels) and 4.28 for SVHN (1000 labels).",,arg_evaluative,0
"The performance of the proposed method is worse than the previous work but they claimed ""state-of-the-art"" results.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper also misses several powerful baselines of semi-supervised learning, e.g. [1,2].",,arg_evaluative,0
The experimental results are not very convincing because many importance baselines are neglected.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- The paper does not have a significant novel contribution, but rather extends GANs (improved-GAN mostly) with a manifold regularization, which has been explored in many other works Kumar et al. (2017) and Qi et al. (2018).",,arg_evaluative,0
"I'm wondering whether other smoothness regularizations can achieve the same effect when applied to semi-supervised learning, e.g. spectral normalization[3].",,arg_request,1

The paper proposes a method to do math reasoning purely using formula embeddings.,,arg_structuring,0
The proposed method employs a graph neural network to embed math formulas to a latent space.,,arg_structuring,0
"The formula embeddings are then combined with theorem embeddings (also formulas, computed in the same way as formula embeddings) to predict whether one can do one step of math reasoning using the corresponding theorem, and also to predict the embeddings of the resulting formula.",,arg_structuring,0
Empirically the authors demonstrate that the method can be chained end-to-end to do multiple steps of reasoning purely in the latent space.,,arg_structuring,0
"I tend to accept this paper, (but also OK if it gets rejected), for the following reasons: (1) the idea is novel and interesting; (2) the writing of the paper is below conference standard and very hard to read, especially the method and the experiment sections.",,arg_evaluative,0
===========================================================================,,arg_structuring,0
Novelty and significance,,arg_structuring,0
I really like the idea of doing math reasoning in latent space.,,arg_evaluative,0

It would be interesting to see how it can improve existing learning-based theorem provers.,,arg_request,1
"My question is if we want to integrate the proposed method into theorem provers, after multiple steps of math reasoning, how would us know the goal has been proved? Is it possible that we can train a decoder that maps back from the latent space to the formula space?",,arg_request,1

Writing,,arg_structuring,0

"1. Typo: Third paragraph in section 1, ""...which is makes use of ..."".",,arg_request,1
2. It's very confusing when the authors introduce \sigma and \omega in the beginning of section 4: why would you need two networks predict the same thing?,,arg_request,1
"3. Mentioning ""merging \sigma and \omega, is left for future work"" is confusing before formally introducing \sigma and \omega.",,arg_evaluative,0
"4. Even when the authors formally introduce \sigma and \omega in 4.2, it is still not clear that why both of them are used for modelling the success probability.",,arg_evaluative,0
"5. In fact, I don't know why \omega needs to output p. It's never mentioned in the experiment section.",,arg_evaluative,0

The idea is nice.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is well aligned with tools that are needed to understand neural networks.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the experiments feel like they are missing motivation as to why this method is being used.",,arg_evaluative,0

The negation example is nice but this doesn't seem to display the potential power of the method to understand a neural network.,,arg_evaluative,0

If the authors don't discuss a motivation then how will a reader know how to apply the tool?,,arg_evaluative,0
It seems there is no conclusion to take away from the experiments in section 5 (convolutions).,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors should rethink the structure of the experimental section from the standpoint of convincing someone to use this method.,,arg_request,1
In section 4.1 the authors have a good discussion on what is wrong with other methods in order to motivate their approach but then they don't deliver significant evidence in the later part of the section.,,arg_request,1
The paper needs more discussion and experiments to explain how and why to use this approach.,,arg_request,1

The authors introduce strategies for pre-training graph neural networks.,,arg_structuring,0
Pre-training is done at the node level as well as at the graph level.,,arg_structuring,0
"They evaluate their approaches on two domains, biology and chemistry on a number of downstream tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
They find that not all pre-training strategies work well and can in fact lead to negative transfer.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, they find that pre-training in general helps over non pre-training.",,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, this paper was well written with useful illustrations and clear motivations.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors evaluate their models over a number of datasets.,,arg_evaluative,0
Experimental construction and analysis also seems sound.,,arg_evaluative,0
I would have liked to see a bit more analysis as to why some pre-training strategies work over others.,,arg_request,1
"However, the authors mention that this is in their planned future work.",,arg_fact,0
"Also, in figure 4, the authors mention that their pre-trained models tend to converge faster.",,arg_fact,0
"However, this does not take into account the time already spent on pre-training. Perhaps the authors can include some results as to the total time taken as well as amortized total time over a number of different downstream tasks.",,arg_request,1
This paper proposes a self-auxiliary-training method that aims to improve the generalization performance of simple supervised learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"The basic idea is to train the classification network to predict fine-level auxiliary labels in addition to the ground-truth coarse label, where the auxiliary labels used in training is generated by a generator network.",,arg_structuring,0
"During training, the classification network and the generator network are alternatively updated, and the update of the latter aims to maximize the improvement of the former after using the generated auxiliary label for training.",,arg_structuring,0
The method requires a class hierarchy in advance to define the binary mask applied to the output layer for auxiliary class prediction.,,arg_structuring,0
A KL divergence term is attached to the optimization objective to avoid generating trivial and collapsing auxiliary classes.,,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
1) The main idea is simple and easy to understand.,,arg_evaluative,0
"2) It discusses the class collapsing problem in generating pseudo (auxiliary) labels and provides a reasonable solution, i.e., using KL divergence as regularization.",,arg_evaluative,0
3) Uses several visualizations to show experimental results.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"1) The problem it aims to solve is neither multi-task learning nor meta-learning: it tries to solve a supervised classification problem defined on principle classes, with the help of simultaneously predicting/generating auxiliary class labels.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Although the concept of ""task"" is not explicitly defined in this paper, the authors seem to associate each task with a specific class.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This is not correct: in meta-learning, each task is a subset of classes drawn from a ground set of classes, and different tasks are independently sampled.",,none,0
"In addition, the classification models for different tasks are independent, though their training might be related by a meta-learner.",,arg_fact,0
"Hence, the claims in multiple places of this paper and the names for the two networks are misleading.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2) At the end of Page 4, the authors show that the update of the generator only depends on the improvement of the classifier after using the auxiliary label for training.",,arg_fact,0
"In fact, the optimal auxiliary labels minimizing the objective is the ground truth label for principle classes.",,arg_fact,0
This results in the class collapsing problem observed by the authors.,,arg_fact,0
"The KL divergence regularization introduces extra randomness to the auxiliary labels and thus mitigates the problem, but it hardly provides any useful information except randomness.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In other words, the auxiliary labels for a specific principle class are very possible to be multiple noisy copies of the principal label with random perturbations.",,none,0
So it is not convincing to me that the auxiliary labels generated by the generator can be really helpful.,,none,0
"My conjecture is that the observed improvements are mainly due to the softness of the auxiliary labels, which has been proved by model compression/knowledge distillation and recent ""born-again neural networks"".",,arg_fact,0
"To verify this, the authors might need to compare the results with those methods (which use the generated soft probability of ground truth classes for training), and the ""random-noisy copies of soft principle label"" mentioned above.",,arg_request,1
"3) The experiments lack comparisons to several important baselines from self-supervised learning community, and methods using soft labels for training (as mentioned in 2) above).",,arg_evaluative,0
"A successful idea of self-supervised learning is to use the output feature map of the trained classification network to generate auxiliary training signals, since it provides extra information about the learned distance beyond the ground-truth labels.",,arg_fact,0
"The authors might want to compare to ""Mathilde Caron, Piotr Bojanowski, Armand Joulin, and Matthijs Douze.",,arg_request,1
"Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features. ECCV 2018."" and ""Carl Doersch and Andrew Zisserman. Multi-task self-supervised visual learning. ICCV 2017."" Moreover, since the method is not a meta-learning approach for few-shot learning, it is not fair and also not appropriate to compare with Prototypical Network.",,arg_other,0
"4) Although the paper claims that the ground truth fine labels are not required, it requires a class hierarchy, which in the experiments are provided by the dataset and defined between true coarse and fine classes.",,arg_fact,0
"In practice, such hierarchy might be much harder to achieve than the primary (coarse) labels, and might be as costly to obtain as the true fine-class labels.",,arg_evaluative,0
This weakens the feasibility of the proposed method.,,none,0
"5) The experiments only test the proposed method on CIFAR100 and CIFAR10, which has at most 100 fine classes.",,arg_fact,0
"It is necessary to test it on datasets with much more fine classes and much-complicated hierarchy, e.g., ImageNet, MS COCO or their subsets, which have ideal class hierarchy structures.",,arg_evaluative,0

Paper's negative points,,arg_structuring,0
- The paper makes use of a result from the David MacKay textbook,,arg_evaluative,0
which defines the capacity of a single layer network to memorize the,,none,0
labelling of $n$ inputs in $d$-dimensional space.,,none,0
If I'm not,,none,0
"mistaken, from this result the authors extrapolate that the capacity",,none,0
of a (deep) neural network,,none,0
is proportional to the number of,,none,0
parameters in the network.,,none,0
"This is true, but there are a",,arg_fact,0
couple of caveats.,,none,0
The first is that the coefficient of,,arg_fact,0
proportionality must depend very much on the number of layers in the,,none,0
network.,,none,0
Increasing the network's depth increases the efficiency of,,arg_fact,0
the representation (i.e. fewer total parameters needed to have the,,none,0
same representational power as a shallow network). And as MacKay,,none,0
also says in his book (chapter 44 quoting findings from Radford,,none,0
Neal) that for MLPs what determines the complexity of the typical,,none,0
function (once the network has a large enough width) represented by,,none,0
"the MLP is the ""characteristic magnitude of the weights"". So the",,none,0
regularization technique applied is very significant in the,,none,0
controlling the effective capacity of a network.,,none,0
This paper,,arg_evaluative,0
experimentally shows that is the case multiple times as it is shown,,none,0
"that with increasing degrees of regularization (figure 1, figure 2)",,none,0
it becomes harder and harder to memorize the positive training,,none,0
images. It would be great if the paper also made some attempt to,,arg_request,1
consider these connections. Or at least comment on how these factors,,none,0
could be incorporated into a more sophisticated analysis of the,,none,0
capacity of a network.,,none,0
- There is a slight oxymoron in the premise of the first set of,,arg_evaluative,0
experiments.,,none,0
The network is forced to memorize a set of,,none,0
positive examples relative to the negative set it sees during,,none,0
training. What is memorized I presume depends a lot on the negative,,none,0
"set used for training (its diversity, closeness to the positive set",,none,0
and how frequently each negative example is seen during,,none,0
training).,,none,0
This issue is not really commented upon in the paper. Is,,arg_evaluative,0
there a training task which would allow one to more explicitly,,none,0
memorize the image (some sort of reconstruction task) as opposed to,,none,0
an in/out classification task?,,none,0
- This paper is a slightly difficult read - not because of the,,arg_evaluative,0
language or the presentation of the material but more because there,,none,0
is not one main coherent argument or goal for the paper.,,none,0
This is,,none,0
"reflected in the ""Related work"" section where 4 different",,none,0
issues/tasks are referred to.,,none,0
Each one of these topics is worthy of,,arg_evaluative,0
"a paper in itself, but this paper dips into each one and then",,none,0
swiftly moves onto the next one.,,none,0
For example in section 3 the paper,,none,0
explores if a network can be forced to explicitly memorize a set of,,none,0
images and how the size of this set is affected by the number of,,none,0
parameters in the network and data augmentation.,,none,0
High-level,,arg_evaluative,0
conclusions are made: more parameters in the network implies more,,none,0
images can be memorized and data-augmentation makes explicit,,none,0
memorization more difficult. Then it is off to considering,,none,0
pre-trained networks and determining whether by analyzing,,none,0
the,,none,0
statistics of the responses at different layers one can decide if a,,none,0
set of images was used for training or not (or similar tasks).,,none,0
Yes,,none,0
the different sections are related but it is does not feel like they,,none,0
build upon each other to help form a clearer picture of memorization,,none,0
within neural networks.,,none,0
- The conclusions focus on the importance of section 3 and,,arg_evaluative,0
the results of the experiments performed. Do the conclusions accurately,,none,0
"reflect the opinions of the author? If yes, would",,none,0
it better to re-organize the paper and devote more of it to the,,none,0
material presented in section 3 and filling this out with more,,none,0
analysis and experiments to perhaps explore the issue of the,,none,0
capacity of a network in more,,none,0
Queries/ points that need some clarification,,arg_structuring,0
- I'm a little unclear when data-augmentation is included in the,,arg_request,1
training phase whether the goal is to be able to also recognise,,none,0
perturbed versions of the input images at test time.,,none,0
In section 3 is,,none,0
a perturbed positive image considered a positive training image? And,,none,0
in the testing phase are only unperturbed versions of the positive,,none,0
images given to the ConvNet as input?,,none,0

"This paper proposes to combine unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation with prototypical networks and finds that the proposed model performs well on few-shot learning task with domain shift, much better than other few-shot learning baselines that do not consider.",,arg_structuring,0
Specifically it tests on Omniglot with natural image background and cliparts to real images.,,arg_structuring,0
"It is true that current meta-learning approaches do not address the problem of domain shift, and as a result, the testing domain has to be the same with the training domain.",,arg_fact,0
"However, this paper rather than proposing solution address the meta-learning problem, albeit the title “meta domain adaptation”, only brings few-shot learning to domain adaptation.",,arg_evaluative,0
Here’s why:,,arg_structuring,0
"In order for a meta-learning model to be called “meta domain adaptation,” the type of adaptation cannot be seen during training, and the goal is to test on adaptation that the model has not seen before.",,arg_fact,0
"Indeed, each task in meta domain adaptation should be seen as a pair of source task and target task.",,arg_fact,0
"The problem with the current model is that during training, it is trained to target at one specific type of test domain--the generator network G aims to generated images that align with the unsupervised  test domain X_test.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Thus, the trained model will also only be able to handle one test domain, not much different than regular meta-learning models.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In short, the meta-learning part stays in the regular few-shot learning module (which is implemented as a prototypical network), and has nothing related to domain adaptation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, the paper cannot be qualified for ``meta domain adaptation’’ and has very limited novelty in terms of its contribution to meta-learning; however, the combination of domain adaptation and few-shot learning is fair.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For the rest of my review, I will treat the paper as “few-shot learning with domain adaptation” for more appropriate analysis.",,arg_structuring,0
"For the experiments, there seems to have a great win of the proposed algorithm against the baselines.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I think since this is few-shot learning with domain adaptation, there is no domain adaptation baselines being mentioned in comparison.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Specifically, what if the few-shot learning component is removed, and the network is trained with standard domain adaptation.",,arg_request,1
Then use the same network to extract the features and then using the nearest neighbor to retrieve the classes.,,arg_fact,0
"Also it seems that the regular batch normalization could be very sensitive to domain shifts, and it would be good if the authors can test other normalization schemes such as layer/group normalization as baselines.",,arg_request,1
Another concern is that the evaluation of domain adaptation does not have much varieties.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Only two domains shifts are evaluated in the paper, specifically Omniglot + BSD500 and Office-Home.",,arg_structuring,0
"BSD 500 only contains 500 images, and it would be good if more diverse set of images are considered.",,arg_request,1
Other domain transfer settings such as synthetic rendered vs. real (e.g. visDA challenge) could have been considered.,,arg_request,1
"In conclusion, the paper presents a interesting combination of ProtoNet + Adversarial DA + Cycle consistency.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, unlike as advertised, the paper does not address the domain shift issue in meta-learning, and the experiments lack thorough evaluation as the paper considers itself as a meta-learning paper and only compares to other meta-learning approaches without much comparison to domain adaptation papers.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, I recommend reject.",,arg_fact,0
---,,arg_structuring,0
"Note: after reading the comments updated by authors, I remain my opinions: even though exact meta-testing data is unseen during training, the domain is seen during training, and therefore it cannot be qualified for being ""meta domain adaptation"".",,arg_evaluative,0
===,,arg_structuring,0
After rebuttal:,,arg_structuring,0
I would like to thank the authors for the response and updating the draft.,,arg_social,0
They have addressed 1) the title issue and 2) adding domain adaptation baselines.,,arg_structuring,0
"Considering these improvements, I would like to raise the score to 5, since the setting of combining few-shot learning and domain adaptation is interesting and the proposed model outperforms the baselines.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, my criticisms remain that the paper is a simple combination of cycle GAN and prototypical networks, and lacks new insights/novelty.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The experiments use fairly small datasets, where the performance can be largely influenced by how good the feature extractor backbone is (e.g. training on more data and using deeper architecture would warrant better performance, and thus may change the conclusion).",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper makes concerted efforts to examine the existing beliefs about the significance of various statistical characteristics of hidden layer activations (or representations) in a DNN.,,arg_structuring,0
"In the past, many works have argued for encouraging the certain statistical behavior of these representations (e.g., sparsity, low correlation etc) in order to have better classification accuracy.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, this paper tries to argue that such efforts are not very useful as these statistical characteristics don't provide any systematic explanation for the performance of DNNs across different settings.",,arg_structuring,0
"First, the paper argues that given a DNN, it's possible to construct either an identical output network or a comparable network that can have very different behavior for some of the statistical characteristics.",,arg_structuring,0
This casts doubt on the usefulness of these characteristics in explaining the performance of the network.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper conducts experiments with different regularizers associated with some of the standard statistical characteristics using the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper claims that for each dataset the best performing network cannot be attributed to any single regularizer.,,arg_structuring,0
"For the same set of regularizers and the MNIST dataset, the paper then explores the mutual information between the inputs and the hidden layer activations.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper observes that the best performing regularizer is the one which minimizes this mutual information.,,arg_structuring,0
"Therefore, it is plausible that the mutual information regularization can consistently explain the performance of an NN.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper addresses an interesting problem and makes some good contributions.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the reviewer feels that the brief treatment of mutual information regularizer leaves something to be desired.",,arg_fact,0
"Did the authors also examine the relationship between mutual information and generalization error for CIFAR data sets? Does it not make sense to examine this for all (most of) the setups considered in Table 4, 8, and 9.",,arg_request,1
"In these tables, how do the authors decide which hidden layer representations should be explored for their statistical characteristics?",,arg_request,1
"The reviewer feels that for CIFAR-10 and 100, some regularizers do consistently give best or close to best networks. Could the authors comment on this?",,arg_request,1
"This paper proposes a Self-Modulation framework for the generator network in GANs, where middle layers are directly modulated as a function of the generator input z.",,arg_fact,0
"Specifically, the method is derived via batch normalization (BN), i.e. the learnable scale and shift parameters in BN are assumed to depend on z, through a small one-hidden layer MLP.",,arg_fact,0
"This idea is something new, although quite straight-forward.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Extensive experiments with varying losses, architectures, hyperparameter settings are conducted to show self-modulation improves baseline GAN performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper is mainly empirical, although the authors compute two diagnostic statistics to show the effect of the self-modulation method.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is still not clear why self-modulation stabilizes the generator towards small conditioning values.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper presents two loss functions at the beginning of section 3.1 - the non-saturating loss and the hinge loss.,,arg_fact,0
"It should be pointed out that the D in the hinge loss represents a neural network output without range restriction, while the D in the non-saturating loss represents sigmoid output, limiting to take in [0,1].",,arg_request,1
It seems that the authors are not aware of this difference.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In addition to report the median scores, standard deviations should be reported.",,arg_request,1
===========,,arg_structuring,0
comments after reading response ===========,,arg_structuring,0
I do not see in the updated paper that this typo (in differentiating D in hinge loss and non-saturating loss) is corrected.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Though fundamental understanding can happen asynchronously, I reserve my concern that such empirical method is not substantial enough to motivate acceptance in ICLR, especially considering that in (only) 124/144 (86%) of the studied settings, the results are improved. And there is no analysis of the failure settings.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This manuscript studies mutual-information estimation, in particular variational lower bounds, and focuses on reducing their sample complexity.",,arg_structuring,0
The first contribution is based on adapting the MINE energy-based MI estimator family to out-of-sample testing.,,arg_structuring,0
"MINE involves fitting a very flexible parametric form of the distribution, such as a neural network, to the data to derive a mutual information lower bound.",,arg_structuring,0
"The present work separates the data fitting from the mutual information evaluation to decrease sample complexity, the argument being that the function class is no longer a limiting factor to sample complexity of the mutual information estimation.",,arg_structuring,0
"The second contribution uses meta learning to decrease the sample complexity required to fit the neural network, creating a family of tasks derived from the data with data transformation that do not modify the mutual information.",,arg_structuring,0
"The approaches are demonstrated on synthetic data as well as fMRI data, to detect significant inter-subject dependencies in time-series of neural responses.",,arg_structuring,0
There are some very interesting and strong contributions of this manuscript.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I worry that one of the central theoretical arguments does not seem correct to me.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Indeed, the manuscript introduces sample complexity results to justify the benefits of the out-of-sample procedure (th 1), but it seems to me that these give an incomplete picture.",,arg_evaluative,0
Th 1 gives the number of validation samples required to bound error between the mutual information estimate at finite samples and asymptotically for a function T parametrized by \tilda{theta}. This control is of a very different nature from the control established by MIME which controls the error to the actual best possible variational bound.,,arg_fact,0
"In other terms, the control of th 1 does not control the estimation error of T. This is the reason why it is independent from the function class.",,arg_fact,0
"The total error in estimating the mutual information must take this error in account, and not only the validation error.",,arg_evaluative,0
Hence the theoretical sample complexities contributed are not comparable to those of MIME.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The meta-learning estimator seems to involve a significant implementation complexity, for instance heuristic switchs between estimation approaches.",,arg_fact,0
The danger is that could hard to make reliable in a wide set of applications.,,arg_fact,0
It would be more convincing to see more experiments.,,arg_request,1
"Along this direction, it is problematic that, in the synthetic examples, the relative  performance of methods changes significantly from experiment to experiment and there does not seem to be a simple way to control that.",,arg_evaluative,0
"On the other hand, the MIME-f-ES tends to have a reasonably good failure mode.",,arg_fact,0
"I would have been interested in ""false detection"" experiments: comparing estimator in a variety of problems where the mutual information is zero, but for different marginal distribution.",,arg_request,1
"This is particularly important when the application is to test for independence, as in the fMRI experiments.",,arg_fact,0
"For hyper-parameter search (using hyperopt), the manuscript should make it explicit what metric is optimized.",,arg_fact,0
Is it the data fit of the neural networks? With what specific measure?,,arg_request,1
"With regards to the fMRI experiments, good baselines are missing: DEMINE is compared to Pearson correlation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Additionally, CNNs are not a particularly good architecture for fMRI, as fMRI is not locally translation invariant (see Aydöre ICML 2019 for instance).",,arg_fact,0
"Finally, it seems that the goal here is to test for independence.",,arg_fact,0
"In such a situation, there are better strategies for higher-order tests of independence than estimating mutual information, in particular estimator that give a control p-value.",,arg_evaluative,0

Alg 1 seems a fairly generic neural-network fitting algorithm.,,arg_fact,0

Review for MANIFOLD REGULARIZATION WITH GANS FOR SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING,,arg_structuring,0
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
The paper proposed to incorporate a manifold regularization penalty to the GAN to adapt to semi-supervised learning.,,arg_structuring,0
They approximate this penalty empirically by calculating stochastic finite differences of the generator’s latent variables.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper does a good job of motivating the additional regularization penalty and their approximation to it with a series of experiments and intuitive explanations.,,arg_structuring,0
The experiment results are very through and overall promising.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is presented in a clear manner with only minor issues.,,arg_evaluative,0
Novelty/Significance:,,arg_structuring,0
The authors’ add a manifold regularization penalty to GAN discriminator’s loss function.,,arg_structuring,0
"While this is a simple and seemingly obvious approach, it had to be done by someone.",,arg_fact,0
"Thus while I don’t think their algorithm is super novel, it is significant and thus novel enough.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Additionally, the authors’ use of gradients of the generator as an approximation for the manifold penalty is a clever.",,arg_evaluative,0
Questions/Clarity:,,arg_structuring,0
It would be helpful to note in the description of Table 3 what is better (higher/lower).,,arg_request,1
Also Table 3 seems to have standard deviations missing in Supervised DCGANs and Improved GAN for 4000 labels. And is there an explanation on why there isn’t an improvement in the FID score of SVHN for 1000 labels?,,arg_request,1
"What is the first line of Table 4? Is it supposed to be combined with the second? If not, then it is missing results. And is the Pi model missing results or can it not be run on too few labels? If it can’t be run, it would be helpful to state this.",,arg_request,1
"On page 11, “in Figure A2” the first word needs to be capitalized.",,arg_request,1
"In Figure A1, why is there a dark point at one point in the inner circle? What makes the gradient super high there?",,arg_request,1
What are the differences of the 6 pictures in Figure A7? Iterations?,,arg_request,1
"In the manuscript entitled ""Neural Causal Discovery with Learnable Input Noise"" the authors describe a method for automated causal inference under the scenario of a stream of temporally structured random variables (with no missingness and a look-back window of given size).",,arg_structuring,0
"The proposed approach combines a novel measure of the importance of fidelty in each variable to predictive accuracy of the future system state (""learnable noise risk"") with a flexible functional approximation (neural network).",,arg_structuring,0
"Although the setting (informative temporal data) is relatively restricted with respect to the general problem of causal inference, this is not unreasonable given the proposed direction of application to automated reasoning in machine learning.",,arg_structuring,0
The simulation and real data experiments are interesting and seem well applied.,,arg_evaluative,0
"A concern I have is that the manuscript as it stands is positioned somewhere between two distinct fields (sparse learning/feature selection, and causal inference for counterfactual estimation/decision making), but doesn't entirely illustrate its relationship to either.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, the derived criterion is comparable to other sparsity-inducing penalities on variable inclusion in machine learning models; although it has motivation in causality it is not exclusively derived from this position, so one might wonder how alternative sparsity penalities might perform on the same challenge.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Likewise, it is not well explained what is the value of the learnt relationships, and how uncertainty and errors in the causal learning are relevant to the downstream use of the learnt model.",,arg_evaluative,0
In the ordinary feature selection regime one is concerned simply with improving the predictive capacity of models: e.g. a non-linear model might be fit using just the causal variables that might out-perform both a linear model and a non-linear model fit using all variables.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Here the end goal is less clear; this is understandable in the sense that the work is positioned as a piece in a grand objective, but it would seem valuable to nevertheless describe some concrete example(s) to elucidate this aspect of the algorithm (use case / error effects downstream).",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper introduces a simple measure of tunability that allows to compare optimizers under varying resource constraints.,,arg_structuring,0
The tunability of the optimizer is a weighted sum of best performance at a given budget.,,arg_fact,0
"The authors found that in a setting with low budget for hyperparameter tuning, tuning only Adam optimizer’s learning rate is likely to be a very good choice; it doesn’t guarantee the best possible performance, but it is evidently the easiest to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations.",,arg_structuring,0
Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The motivation of defining tunability of optimizer is a very interesting question, however, the study seems to preliminary and the conclusion is not quite convencing due to several reasons:",,arg_evaluative,0
"In section 3.2, to characterize its difficulties of finding best hyperparameters or tunability, the authors seem to try to connect the concept of “sharpness” of a minima in loss surface to the tunability of an optimizer, which is similar to comparing the loss landscape of minimums.",,none,0
"However, while the authors made intuitive explanation about the tunability in section 2.2, I did not see the actual plot of the true hyperpaparameter loss surface of each optimizer to verify these intuitions.",,none,0
"Can the author be more specific about the x-axis in the illustration 1.a and 1.b? If I understand correctly, they are not the number of trails.",,arg_request,1
"In addition, the proposed stability metric seems not quite related with the above intuitions, as the illustrations (1.a and 1b) define the tunability to be the flatness of hyperparameter space around the best configurations, but the proposed definition is a weighted sum of the incumbents in terms of the HPO budgets.",,none,0
"The definition of the tuning budgets is not clear, is it the number of trials or the time/computation budgets?",,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors seems interchangeably using “runs” and “iterations”, which makes the concept more confusable.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors further proposed three weighting schemes to emphasize the tunability of different stage of HPO.,,arg_structuring,0
"My concern is that is highly dependent  on the order of hyperparameter searched, which could impact the tunability significantly.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For instance, in case of grid search HPO and 0.1 is the best learning rate, different search order such as [10, 1, 0.01, 0.1] and [0.1, 0.01, 1, 10] could results in dramatic different CPE and CPL.",,none,0
My major concern is the hyperparameter distributions for each optimizer highly requires prior knowledge.,,none,0
"A good prior of one optimizer could significantly affect the HPO cost or increase the tunability, i.e., the better understanding the optimizer, the less tuning cost.",,arg_fact,0
"My major concern is that the authors assume the hyperparameters to be independent (section 3.2), which is not necessarily true.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Actually hyperparameters are highly correlated, such as momentum, batch size and learning rate are correlated in terms of effective learning rate [1,2], so as weight decay and learning rate are [3], which means using non-zero momentum is equivalent to using large learning rate as long as the effective learning rate is the same.",,none,0
This could significantly increase the tunability of SGDM.,,none,0
Another concurrent submission [4] verified this equivalence and showed one can also just tune learning rate for SGDM.,,arg_fact,0
"The assumption of independent hyperparameters might be fine for black box optimization or with the assumption that practitioners have no knowledge of the importance of each hyperparameter, then the tunability of the optimizer could be different based on the prior knowledge of hyperparameter and their correlations. But it is not rigorous enough to make the conclusion that Adam is easier to tune than SGD.",,none,0
The author states their method to determine the priors by training each task specified in the DEEPOBS with a large number of hyperparameter samplings and retain the hyperparameters which resulted in performance within 20% of the best performance obtained.,,arg_fact,0
Could the authors be more specific on the hyperparameters searched? Is this process counted in the tunability measurement?,,arg_evaluative,0

How about combining only Pose2Pose/ Pose2Frame  with pix2pixHD? Whether the performance can get improved?,,arg_request,1
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper introduces a generative model for 3D point clouds.,,arg_structuring,0
"Authors aim at theoretically showing the difficulties of using existing generative models to learn distributions of point clouds, and propose a variant that supposedly solves the issues.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
+ The problem of designing generative models for 3D data is important.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"- Paper is often hard to follow, and contains a significant number of typos.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- Authors claim to identify a fundamental problem with the existing generative models for point clouds, yet Section 2 tries to show that a _specific version_ that uses DeepSet does not satisfy theoretical guarantees. What if we use e.g. a recurrent network instead?",,arg_request,1
"As is, the counter example proof itself is quite confusing: it would really help if the proof was more formal.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- Jointly learning an inference network (Q) has certainly been done before, and I am not sure authors provide an elaborate enough explanation of what is the difference with adversarially learned inference /  adversarial feature learning.",,arg_evaluative,0
- It is not clear why authors did not follow the evaluation protocol of [Achlioptas’17] or [Wu’16] more closely.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, evaluation for the classification task should be compatible with the proposed model, which would give a much better picture of the learned representations.",,arg_fact,0
The paper proposes a novel training method for variational autoencoders that allows using partially-observed data with multiple modalities.,,arg_structuring,0
"A modality can be a whole block of features (e.g., a MNIST image) or just a single scalar feature.",,arg_structuring,0
The probabilistic model contains a latent vector per modality.,,arg_structuring,0
"The key idea is to use two types of encoder networks: a unimodal encoder for every modality which is used when the modality is observed, and a shared multimodal encoder that is provided all the observed modalities and produces the latent vectors for the unobserved modalities.",,arg_structuring,0
"The whole latent vector is passed through a decoder that predicts the mask of observed modalities, and another decoder that predicts the actual values of all modalities.",,arg_structuring,0
The “ground truth” values for the unobserved modalities are provided by sampling from the corresponding latent variables from the prior distribution once at some point of training.,,arg_structuring,0
"While I like the premise of the paper, I feel that it needs more work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"My main concern is that sampling the target values for the unobserved modalities from the prior would almost necessarily lead to blurry synthetic “ground truth” for these modalities, which in turn means that the model would produce underconfident predictions for them.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The samples from MNIST in Figure 3 are indeed very blurry, supporting this.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore, the claims of the model working for non-MCAR missingness are not substantiated by the experiments.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I believe that the paper should currently be rejected, but I encourage the authors to revise the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
* Generative modelling of partially observed data is a very important topic that would benefit from fresh ideas and new approaches,,arg_evaluative,0
* I really like the idea of explicitly modelling the mask/missingness vector. I agree with the authors that this should help a lot with non completely random missingness.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
* The text is quite hard to read.,,arg_evaluative,0
There are many typos (see below).,,arg_evaluative,0
"The text is over the 8 page limit, but I don’t think this is justified.",,arg_fact,0
"For example, the paragraph around Eqn. (11) just says that the decoder takes in a concatenated latent vector.",,arg_structuring,0
"The MNIST+SVHN dataset setup is described in detail, yet there is no summary of the experimental results, which are presented in the appendix.",,arg_evaluative,0
* The approach taken to train on partially-observed data is described in three sentences after the Eqn. (10).,,arg_structuring,0
The non-observed dimensions are imputed by reconstructions from the prior from a partially trained model.,,arg_structuring,0
I think that this is the crux of the paper that should be significantly expanded and experimentally validated.,,arg_request,1
It is possible that due to this design choice the method would not produce sharper reconstructions than the original samples from the prior.,,arg_fact,0
"Figures 3, 5 and 6 indeed show very blurry samples from the model.",,arg_structuring,0
"Furthermore, it is not obvious to me why these prior samples would be sensible at all, given that all modalities have independent latents by construction.",,arg_evaluative,0
"* The paper states multiple times that VAEAC [Ivanov et al., 2019] cannot handle partially missing data, but I don’t think this is true, since their missing features imputation experiment uses the setup of 50% truly missing features.",,arg_evaluative,0
The trick they use is adding “synthetic” missing features in addition to the real ones and only train on those.,,arg_fact,0
See Section 4.3.3 of that paper for more details.,,arg_other,0
* The paper states that “it can model the joint distribution of the data and the mask together and avoid limiting assumptions such as MCAR”.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, all experiments only show results in the MCAR setting, so the claim is not experimentally validated.",,arg_evaluative,0
* The baselines in the experiments could be improved.,,arg_request,1
"First of all, the setup for the AE and VAE is not specified.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Secondly, it would be good to include a GAN-based baseline such as GAIN, as well as some more classic feature imputation method, e.g. MICE or MissForest.",,arg_request,1
"* The experiments do not demonstrate that the model learns a meaningful *conditional* distribution for the missing modalities, since the provided figures show just one sample per conditioning image.",,arg_evaluative,0
Questions to the authors:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Could you comment on the differences in your setup in Section 4.1 compared to the VAEAC paper? I’ve noticed that the results you report for this method significantly differ from the original paper, e.g. for VAEAC on Phishing dataset you report PFC of 0.24, whereas the original paper reports 0.394; for Mushroom it’s 0.403 vs. 0.244. I’ve compared the experimental details yet couldn’t find any differences, for example the missing rate is 0.5 in both papers.",,arg_request,1
"2. How do you explain that all methods have NRMSE > 1 on the Glass dataset (Table 1), meaning that they all most likely perform worse than a constant baseline?",,arg_request,1

The idea of having a separate class for out-distribution is a very interesting idea but unfortunately previously explored.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In fact, in machine learning and NLP there is the OOV class which sometimes people in computer vision also use.",,arg_evaluative,0
Some of the claims in the paper can be further substantiated or explored.,,arg_other,0
For example in abstract there is a simple claim that is presented too strong: We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries.,,arg_fact,0
This claim is bigger than just CNNs and needs to be studied in a theoretical framework not an empirical one.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, one simple way to stop these adversarial cases would be to explore using Sigmoid as opposed to softmax.",,arg_evaluative,0
In general it is very unlikely that you will be able to choose every variation of out-distribution cases.,,arg_evaluative,0
Much easier if you just try to solve the problem using a set of n Sigmoids (n total number of classes) and consider each output a probability distribution.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the studies in this paper are still valuable and I strongly recommend continuing on the same direction.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In this paper, the authors address representation learning in non-Euclidean spaces.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors are motivated by constant curvature geometries, that can  provide a useful trade-off between Euclidean representations and Riemannian manifolds, i.e. arriving at more suitable representations than possible in the Euclidean space, while not sacrifising closed-form formulae for estimating distances, gradients and so on.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors point out that an extension of the gyrovector space formalization to spaces of constant positive curvature (spherical) is required, and with the corresponding formalization for hyperbolic spaces, one can arrive at a unified formalism that can interpolate smoothly between all geometries of constant curvature.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors propose to do so by replacing  the curvature while flipping the sign in the standard Poincare model.,,arg_structuring,0
"This is a strong point reagarding this work, as it seems that no such unification has been attempted in the past (although simply replacing the curvature in the Poincare model seems a bit too straightforward to not have been attempted, it seems to be the case).",,arg_structuring,0
The authors also provide extensive supplementary material (around 20 pages) with detailed derivations and descriptions of experiments.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This also makes me wonder if this paper is more suitable for a journal - both in terms of the extensive supplementary material (e.g., curvature sampling algorithm and other details can be found only in supplementary), as well as the more rigorous review process that a journal paper goes through.",,arg_request,1
"In the main paper, only proof of concept experiments are provided (one experiment), that nevertheless show competitive performance under varying settings.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, it seems to me that such contributions in the rising field of geometric deep learning, where several challenges are yet to be overcome, can be beneficial for future research.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Since in the supplementary experiments also, it seems that curvature does have small variance in the results, how would the authors assess the robustness of the curvature sampling method with respect to the results?",,arg_request,1
Overall:,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper introduces the Scratchpad Encoder, a novel addition to the sequence to sequence (seq2seq) framework and explore its effectiveness in generating natural language questions from a given logical form.",,arg_structuring,0
"The proposed model enables the decoder at each time step to modify all the encoder outputs, thus using the encoder as a “scratchpad” memory to keep track of what has been generated so far and to guide future generation.",,arg_structuring,0
Quality and Clarity:,,arg_structuring,0
-- The paper is well-written and easy to read.,,arg_evaluative,0
-- Consider using a standard fonts for the equations.,,arg_request,1
Originality :,,arg_structuring,0
The idea of question generation: using logical form to generate meaningful questions for argumenting data of QA tasks is really interesting and useful.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Compared to several baselines with a fixed encoder, the proposed model allows the decoder to attentively write “decoding information” to the “encoder” output.",,arg_evaluative,0
The overall idea and motivation looks very similar to the coverage-enhanced models where the decoder also actively “writes” a message (“coverage”) to the encoder's hidden states.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In the original coverage paper (Tu et.al, 2016), they also proposed a “neural network based coverage model” where they used a general neural network output to encode attention history, although this paper works differently where it directly updates the encoder hidden states with an update vector from the decoder.",,arg_fact,0
"However, the modification is slightly marginal but seems quite effective.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is better to explain the major difference and the motivation of updating the hidden states.,,arg_evaluative,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper, considers methods for solving smooth unconstrained min-max optimization problems.",,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, the authors prove that the Hamiltonian Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm converges with linear convergence rate to the min-max solution.",,arg_structuring,0
One of the main contributions of this work is that the proposed analysis is focusing on last iterate convergence guarantees for the HGD.,,arg_structuring,0
"This result, as the authors claim can be particularly useful in the future for analyzing more general settings (nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems).",,arg_structuring,0
"In addition, two preliminary convergence theorems were provided for two extensions of HGD: (i) a stochastic variant of HGD and (ii)  Consensus Optimization Algorithm (CO) (by establishing connections of CO and HGD).",,arg_structuring,0
Main Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is well written and the main contributions are clear.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I believe that the idea of the paper is interesting and the convergence analysis seems correct, however i have some concerns regarding  the presentation and the combination of different assumptions used in the theory.",,arg_evaluative,0
1) I think definition 2.5 of Higher order Lipschitz is very strong assumption to have. What exactly means? Essentially the authors upper bounded any difficult term appear in the theorems. Is it possible to avoid having something so strong? Please elaborate.,,arg_request,1
2) In assumption 3.1 is not clear what $L_H$ is.,,arg_request,1
This quantity never mentioned before.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Reading the Lemmas of Section 4 (Lemma 4.4) you can see that it is the smoothness parameter of function $H$. Thus, is not necessary to have it there (not important for the definition).",,arg_evaluative,0
"3) What is the main difference on the combination of assumptions on Theorems 3.2, 3.2 and 3.4. Which one is stronger. Is there a reason for the existence of Theorem 3.3?",,arg_request,1
4) All the results heavily depend on the PL condition.,,arg_fact,0
"I think having this in mind, showing the convergence of Theorems 3.2-3.4 is somehow trivial.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, one can propose several combinations of assumptions in order for the function H to satisfy the PL condition.",,arg_fact,0
Can we avoid having the PL condition?,,arg_request,1
The authors need to elaborate more on this.,,arg_request,1
"5) In Theorem 5.2, the term 1/sqrt(2) is missing from the final bound.",,arg_evaluative,0
Minor Suggestions:,,arg_structuring,0
"In first paragraph of page 5 where the authors divide the existing literature into the three particular cases, I am suggesting to add the refereed papers inside each one of this cases (which papers assumed function g bilinear , which papers strongly convex-concave etc.)",,arg_request,1
I understand that the main contribution of the work is the theoretical analysis of the proposed method but would like to see some numerical evaluation in the main paper.,,arg_request,1
There are some preliminary results in the appendix but it will be useful for the reader if there are are some plots showing the benefit of the method in comparison with existing methods that guarantee convergence (which method is faster?).,,arg_request,1
In the current experiments there is a comparison only with CO algorithm and SGDA.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In general i find the paper interesting, with nice ideas and I believe that will be appreciated from researchers that are interested on smooth games and their connections to machine learning applications.",,arg_evaluative,0
I suggest weak accept but I am open to reconsider in case that my above concerns are answered.,,arg_social,0
**********after rebuttal,,arg_structuring,0
********,,none,0
I would like to thank the authors for their reply and for the further clarification.,,arg_social,0
I will keep my score the same but I highly encourage the authors to add some clarification related to my last comment on the globally bounded gradient.,,arg_request,1
In their response they mentioned that the analysis only requires that  H is smooth and that $\|\xi(x^{(0)})\|$ is sufficient bound.,,arg_structuring,0
This needs to be clear in the paper (add clear arguments and related references).,,arg_request,1
"In addition, in their response they highlight the non-increasing nature of function H over the course of the algorithm which is important for their argument.",,arg_structuring,0
Having this in mind note that the theoretical results on stochastic variant presented in the paper are wrong.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In SGD,  function H does not necessarily decrease over the course of the algorithm.",,arg_fact,0
The authors either need to remove these results or restate them in a different way in order to satisfy the assumed conditions.,,arg_request,1

A sandwiching objective function is proposed to achieve a better estimation of Wasserstein distance.,,arg_structuring,0

Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
1. Authors calculate W_U in a primal form via solving an assignment programming problem.,,arg_structuring,0
Have authors ever tried Sinkhorn iteration?,,arg_request,1
"To my knowledge, sinkhorn iteration is a very popular method to solve OT problem effectively.",,arg_fact,0
It would be nice if authors can provide some reasons and comparisons for their choice on the optimizer of W_U.,,arg_request,1
2.,,arg_structuring,0
"Authors proved that the sandwiching object W_s is closer to the real Wasserstein distance, but it increases the variance of the loss function.",,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, the dynamics of W_U, and W_L, according to lemma1, is (epsilon2-epsilon1)*w(P, G) while the dynamics of W_s is 2*epsilon1 * w(P, G), and 2epsilon1 > epsilon2 - epsilon1 (according to the assumption in lemma 1).",,arg_structuring,0
Does it mean that the W_s is not as stable as W_L or W_U during training?,,arg_request,1
"Additionally, authors combined W_U with W_L with a mixture 20:1, i.e., the s in Eqs(6, 13, 14) is smaller than 0.05.",,arg_structuring,0
"In such a situation, both the value and the dynamics of W_s will be very close to that of W_U. Does it mean that W_L is not so important as W_U?",,arg_request,1
Authors should analyze the stability of their method in details.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Essentially, the proposed method is a variant of WGAN, which estimates Wasserstein distance with lower bias but may suffer from worse stability.",,arg_fact,0
"In the experiments, both the setting and the experimental results show that the proposed W_s will be very close to W_U. As a result, the improvement caused by the proposed method is incremental compared with its variants.",,arg_evaluative,0

"The authors propose three improvements to the DNC model: masked attention, erasion of de-allocated elements, and sharpened temporal links --- and show that this allows the model to solve synthetic memory tasks faster and with better precision.",,arg_structuring,0
They also show the model performs better on average on bAbI than the original DNC.,,arg_structuring,0
"The negatives are that the paper does not really show this modified DNC can solve a task that the original DNC could not. As the authors also admit, there have been other DNC improvements that have had more dramatic improvements on bAbI.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I think the paper is particularly clearly written, and I would vote for it being accepted as it has implications beyond the DNC.",,arg_evaluative,0
The fact that masked attention works so much better than the standard cosine-weighted content-based attention is pretty interesting in itself.,,arg_fact,0

Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
1. The proposed Pose2Pose successfully transfer the pose conditioned on the past pose and the input control signal.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The proposed conditioned residual block, occlusion augmentation and stopping criteria seem to help the Pose2Pose network work well.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides, the object is also considered in this network, which makes the method generalized well to the videos where human holds some rigid object.",,arg_evaluative,0
2. The Pose2Frame network is similar to previous works but learns to predict the soft mask to incorporate the complex background and to produce shallow.,,arg_evaluative,0
The mask term in Eq. (7) seems to work well for the foreground (body+object) and the shallow regions.,,arg_evaluative,0
3. The paper is easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Since the method is only evaluated on several video sequences, I am not sure how the method will perform on other different scenes.",,arg_evaluative,0
Results on more scenes will make the performance more convincing.,,arg_request,1
"I also wonder if the video data will be released, which could be important for the following comparisons.",,arg_request,1
"2. As to the results of the Pose2Pose network, I wonder if there are some artifacts that will affect the performance of the Pose2Frame network.",,arg_request,1

"I assume the authors first train the Pose2Pose network, then use the output to train the Pose2Frame network.",,arg_other,0
"Otherwise, the artifacts from Pose2Pose will affect the testing performance of the Pose2Frame network.",,arg_evaluative,0

"In summary, the quality of the paper is poor and the originality of the work is low.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is easily readable.,,arg_evaluative,0
Summary: This paper is about models for solving basic math problems.,,arg_structuring,0
The main contribution is a synthetically generated dataset that includes a variety of types and difficulties of math problems; it is both larger and more varied than previous datasets of this type.,,arg_structuring,0
"The dataset is then used to evaluate a number of recurrent models (LSTM, LSTM+attention, transformer); these are very powerful models for general sequence-sequence tasks, but they are not explicitly tailored to math problems.",,arg_structuring,0
"The results are then analyzed and insights are derived explaining where neural models seemingly cope well with math tasks, and where they fall down.",,arg_structuring,0
Strengths: I am happy to see the proposal of a very large dataset with a lot of different axes for measuring and examining the performance of models.,,arg_evaluative,0
"There are challenging desiderata involved in building the training+tests sets, and the authors have an interesting and involved methodology to accomplish these.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper is very clearly written. I'm not aware of a comparable work, so the novelty here seems good.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Weaknesses: The dataset created here is entirely synthetic, and the paper only includes one single small real-world case; it seems like it would be easy to generate a larger and more varied real world dataset as well (possibly from the large literature of extant solved problems in workbooks).",,arg_evaluative,0
It would have been useful to compare the general models here with some specific math problem-focused ones as well.,,arg_request,1
Some details weren't clear to me.,,arg_evaluative,0

* Summary,,arg_structuring,0
This paper addresses machine reading tasks involving tracking the states of entities over text.,,arg_structuring,0
"To this end, it proposes constructing a knowledge graph using recurrent updates over the sentences of the text, and using the graph representation to condition a reading comprehension module.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper reports positive evaluations on three different tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
* Review,,arg_structuring,0
This is an interesting paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
The key technical component in the proposed approach is the idea that keeping track of entity states requires (soft) coreference between newly read entities and locations and the ones existing in the knowledge graph constructed so far.,,arg_structuring,0
"The proposed method seems plausible, but some details are impressionistic and it is not clear why and whether the modeling choices do what the paper says.",,arg_evaluative,0
This is especially the case in a few places involving coreference:,,arg_fact,0
1. The paper says at the top of page 6 that the result of Eq 1 is a disambiguated intermediate node representation.,,arg_structuring,0
2. The self attention in Eq 2 performs coreference disamguation which prevents different instances of the same location from being predicted for multiple entities.,,arg_structuring,0
"While these may indeed be working as advertised, it would be good to see some evaluation that verifies that after learning, what is actually happening is coreference.",,arg_request,1

[Summary],,arg_structuring,0
This paper presents a multi-task learning approach for VQA that represent a solver for each task as a neural module that calls existing modules in a program manner.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors manually design the task hierarchy and propose a progressive module network to recursive calls the lower modules and gather the information by soft-attention.,,arg_structuring,0
The final prediction uses all the states and question to infer the final answers.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the performance of different tasks and modules.,,arg_structuring,0
Experiment on VQA shows the proposed model benefits from utilizing different modules.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors also qualitatively show the model's reasoning process and human study on judging answering quality.,,arg_structuring,0

1. The proposed method is novel and explores to use the existing modules as a black box for visual question answering.,,arg_evaluative,0
This is different from most existing work.,,arg_evaluative,0

"3: The experiment results are good, especially for the counting problem.",,arg_evaluative,0
[Weakness],,arg_structuring,0
"1. The title of the paper is ""visual reasoning by progressive module networks."" The title may be a little overstated since the major task is focused on visual question answering (VQA).",,arg_evaluative,0
2. Annotation is not clear in this paper.,,arg_evaluative,0

"From the supplementary, it seems Epsilon means the environment?",,arg_request,1
"3. On the object counting task, the query transmitter needs to produce a query for a relationship module.",,arg_fact,0
The authors mentioned that this is softly calculated by softmax on the importance score.,,arg_fact,0

4. The cider score of image captioning is 109 compared to the baseline 108.,,arg_fact,0
The explanation is the COCO dataset has a fixed set of 80 object categories and does not benefit from training the diverse data.,,arg_fact,0
"Since the input visual feature is the same, the only difference is the proposed model has additional label embedding as input.",,arg_fact,0

Summary,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper proposes to modify the ""Dual Learning"" approach to supervised (and unsupervised) translation problems by making use of additional pretrained mappings for both directions (i.e. primal and dual).",,arg_structuring,0
"These pre-trained mappings (""agents"") generate targets from the primal to the dual domain, which need to be mapped back to the original input.",,arg_structuring,0
It is shown that having >=1 additional agents improves training of the BLEU score in standard MT and unsupervised MT tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
"The method is also applied to unsupervised image-to-image ""translation"" tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
Positives and Negatives,,arg_structuring,0
+1 Simple and straightforward method with pretty good results on language translation.,,arg_evaluative,0
"+2 Does not require additional computation during inference, unlike ensembling.",,arg_structuring,0
-1 The mathematics in section 3.1 is unclear and potentially flawed (more below).,,arg_evaluative,0
"-2 Diversity of additional ""agents"" not analyzed (more below).",,arg_evaluative,0
"-3 For image-to-image translation experiments, no quantitative analysis whatsoever is offered so the reader can't really conclude anything about the effect of the proposed method in this domain.",,arg_evaluative,0
"-4 Talking about ""agents"" and ""Multi-Agent"" is a somewhat confusing given the slightly different use of the same term in the reinforcement literature. Why not just ""mapping"" or ""network""?",,arg_request,1
-1: Potential Issues with the Maths.,,arg_structuring,0
"The maths is not clear, in particular the gradient derivation in equation (8).",,arg_evaluative,0
Let's just consider the distortion objective on x (of course it also applies to y without loss of generality).,,arg_other,0
"At the very least we need another ""partial"" sign in front of the ""\delta"" function in the numerator.",,arg_evaluative,0
"But again, it's not super clear how the paper estimates this derivative.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Intuitively the objective wants f_0 to generate samples which, when mapped back to the X domain, have high log-probability under G, but its samples cannot be differentiated in the case of discrete data.",,arg_fact,0
So is the REINFORCE estimator used or something? Not that the importance sampling matter is orthogonal.,,arg_request,1
"In the case of continuous data x, is the reparameterization trick used?",,arg_request,1
This should at the very least be explained more clearly.,,arg_evaluative,0
Note that the importance sampling does not affect this issue.,,arg_fact,0
-2: Diversity of Agents.,,arg_structuring,0
"As with ensembles, clearly it only helps to have multiple agents (N>2) if the additional agents are distinct from f_1 (again without loss of generality this applies to g as well).",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposes to use different random seeds and iterate over the dataset in a different order for distinct pretrained f_i.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper should quantify that this leads to diverse ""agents"".",,arg_request,1
"I suppose the proof is in the pudding; as we have argued, multiple agents can only improve performance if they are distinct, and Figure 1 shows some improvement as the number of agents are increase (no error bars though).",,arg_fact,0
The biggest jump seems to come from N=1 -> N=2 (although N=4 -> N=5 does see a jump as well).,,arg_structuring,0
"Presumably if you get a more diverse pool of agents, that should improve things.",,arg_fact,0
"Have you considered training different agents on different subsets of the data, or trying different learning algorithms/architectures to learn them?",,arg_request,1
More experiments on the diversity would help make the paper more convincing.,,arg_request,1
The paper investigates the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for constructing adversarial examples both in a white-box and black-box setting.,,arg_fact,0
The authors provide both a theoretical analysis (convergence to a stationary point) and experiments for an InceptionV3 network on ImageNet.,,arg_fact,0
"The main claim is that the proposed algorithm can construct adversarial examples faster than various baselines (PGD, I-FGSM, CW, etc.), and from fewer queries in a black-box setting.",,arg_fact,0
"The FW algorithm is a classical method in optimization, but (to the best of my knowledge) has not yet been evaluated yet for constructing adversarial examples.",,arg_fact,0
Hence it is a natural question to understand whether FW performs significantly better than current algorithms in this context.,,arg_fact,0
"Indeed, the authors find that FW is 6x - 20x faster for constructing white-box adversarial examples than a range of relevant baseline, which is a significant speed-up.",,arg_fact,0
"However, there are several points about the experiments that are unclear to me:",,arg_structuring,0
- It is well known that the running times of optimization algorithms are highly dependent on various hyperparameters such as the step size.,,arg_fact,0
But the authors do not seem to describe how they chose the hyperparameters for the baselines algorithms.,,arg_evaluative,0
Hence it is unclear how large the running time improvement is compared to a well-tuned baseline.,,arg_evaluative,0
- Other algorithms in the comparison achieve a better distortion (smaller perturbation).,,arg_fact,0
"Since finding an adversarial with smaller perturbation is a harder problem, it is unclear how the algorithms compare for finding adversarial examples with similar distortion.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Instead of reporting a single time-vs-distortion data point, the authors could show the full trade-off curve.",,arg_request,1
"- The authors only provide running times, not the number of iterations.",,arg_request,1
"In principle all the algorithms should have a similar bottleneck in each iteration (computing a gradient for the input image), but it would be good to verify this with an iteration count vs success rate (or distortion) plot.",,arg_request,1
This would also allow the authors to compare their theoretical iteration bound with experimental data.,,arg_request,1
"In addition to these three main points, the authors could strengthen their results by providing experiments on another dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) or model architecture (e.g., a ResNet), and by averaging over a larger number of test data points (currently 200).",,arg_request,1
"Overall, I find the paper a promising contribution. But until the authors provide a more thorough experimental evaluation, I hesitate to recommend acceptance.",,arg_evaluative,0
Additional comments:,,arg_structuring,0
The introduction contains a few statements that may paint an incomplete or confusing picture of the current literature in adversarial attacks on neural networks:,,arg_evaluative,0
* The abstract claims that the poor time complexity of adversarial attacks limits their practical usefulness.,,arg_fact,0
"However, the running time of attacks is typically measured in seconds and should not be the limiting element in real-world attacks on deep learning systems.",,arg_fact,0
I am not aware of a setting where the running time of an attack is the main computational bottleneck (outside adversarial training).,,arg_fact,0
"* The introduction distinguishes between ""gradient-based methods"" and ""optimization-based methods"".",,arg_structuring,0
"This distinction is potentially confusing to a reader since the gradient-based methods can be seen as optimization algorithms, and the optimization-based methods rely on gradients.",,arg_fact,0
* The introduction claims that black-box attacks need to estimate gradients coordinate-wise.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, this is not the case already in some of the prior work that uses random directions for estimating gradients (e.g., the cited paper by Ilyas et al.)",,arg_fact,0
I encourage the authors to clarify these points in an updated version of their paper.,,arg_request,1
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0

"- How multimodal are the datasets provided by UCI? It seems like they consist of different tabular datasets with numerical or categorical variables, but it was not clear what the modalities are (each variable is a modality?) and how correlated the modalities are. If they are not correlated at all and share no joint information I'm not sure how these experiments can represent multimodal data.",,arg_request,1
"- Some of the datasets the authors currently test on are quite toy, especially for the image-based MNIST and SVHN datasets.",,arg_evaluative,0
"They should consider larger-scale datasets including image and text-based like VQA/VCR, or video-based like the datasets in (Tsai et al., ICLR 2019).",,arg_request,1
"- In terms of prediction performance, the authors should also compare to [1] and [2] which either predict the other modalities completely during training or use tensor-based methods to learn from noisy or missing time-series data.",,arg_request,1
"- One drawback is that this method requires the mask during training. How can it be adapted for scenarios where the mask is not present? In other words, we only see multiple modalities as input, but we are not sure which are noisy and which are not?",,arg_evaluative,0

Thank you for your detailed answers to my questions.,,arg_social,0
"This paper proposed Compound Density Networks (CDNs), a neural network architecture that parametrises conditional distributions as infinite mixtures, thus generalising the traditional finite mixture density networks (MDNs).",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors realise CDNs by treating the weights of each neural network layer probabilistically, and letting them be matrix variate Gaussians (MVGs) with their parameters given as a function of the layer input via a hypernetwork.",,arg_structuring,0
CDNs can then be straightforwardly optimised with SGD for a particular task by using the reparametrization trick.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors further argue that in case that overfitting is present at CDNs, then an extra KL-divergence term can be employed such that the input dependent MVG distribution is close to a simple prior that is input agnostic.",,arg_structuring,0
"They then proceed to evaluate the predictive uncertainty that CDNs offer on three tasks: a toy regression problem, out-of-distribution example detection on MNIST/notMNIST and adversarial example detection on MNIST and CIFAR 10.",,arg_structuring,0
The objective of this work is to provide a method for better uncertainty estimates from deep learning models.,,arg_structuring,0
This is an important research area and relevant for ICLR.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is generally well written with a clear presentation of the proposed model.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The generalisation from the finite MDN to the continuous CDN seems straightforward, the model is relatively easy to implement and it is evaluated extensively against several modern baselines.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Nevertheless, I believe that it still has to address some points in order to be better suited for publication:",,arg_evaluative,0
"- It seems that the model is not very scalable; while the authors do provide a way of reducing the necessary parameters that the hypernetwork has to predict, minibatching can still be an issue as it is implied that you draw a separate random weight matrix for each datapoint due to the input specific distribution (as shown at Algorithm 1).",,arg_evaluative,0
Is this how you implemented minibatching in practice? How easily is this applied to convolutional architectures?,,arg_request,1
- How many samples did you use from p(theta|x) during training?,,arg_request,1
"It seems that with a single sample the method becomes an instance of VIB [1], only considering the weights of the network as latent variables rather than the hidden units.",,arg_evaluative,0
- The experiments were entirely focused on uncertainty quality but we are always interested in both performance on the task at hand as as well as good uncertainty estimates. What was the performance based on e.g. classification accuracy on each of these tasks compared to the baselines? I believe that including these results will strengthen the paper and provide a more complete picture.,,arg_request,1
- Have you checked / visualised what type of weight distributions do CDNs capture? It would be interesting to see if e.g. the marginal (across the dataset) weight distribution at each layer has any multimodality as that could hint that the network learns to properly specialise to individual data points.,,arg_request,1
"- The authors mention that in order to avoid overfitting they add an extra (weighted) KL-divergence term to the log-likelihood of the dataset, that encourages the weight distributions for specific points to be close to simple priors.",,arg_fact,0
How influential is that extra term to the uncertainty quality that you obtain in the end?,,arg_request,1
How does this term affect the learned distributions in case of CDNs?,,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, the way that CDNs are constructed seems to be more appropriate at capturing input specific uncertainty (i.e. aleatoric) rather than global uncertainty about the data (i.e. epistemic).",,arg_fact,0
I believe that for the specific uncertainty evaluation tasks this paper considers the latter is more appropriate.,,arg_fact,0
More discussion on both of these aspects can help in improving this paper.,,arg_request,1

"As a final point; the hyper parameters that were tuned for the MNF, noisy K-FAC and KFLA baselines are not on common ground.",,arg_evaluative,0
For noisy K-FAC and MNF the lambda (which should be fixed to 1 for a correct Bayesian model) was tuned and in general lower than 1 lambdas lead to models that are overconfident and hence underperform on uncertainty tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0
For KFLA a hyper parameter “tau” was tuned; this hyperparameter instead corresponds to the precision of the Gaussian prior on the parameters.,,arg_fact,0
"In this case, KFLA always optimises a “correct” Bayesian model for every value of the hyperparameter whereas MNF and noisy K-FAC do not.",,arg_fact,0
"Thus I believe that it would be better if you consider the same hyper parameter on all of these methods, e.g. the precision of the Gaussian prior.",,arg_request,1

* The problem is interesting and well explained,,arg_evaluative,0
* The proposed method is clearly motivated,,arg_evaluative,0
* The proposal looks theoretically solid,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"* It is unclear to me whether the ""efficient method for SN in convolutional nets"" is more efficient than the power iteration algorithm employed in previous work, such as Miyato et al. 2018, which also used SN in conv nets with different strides.",,arg_evaluative,0

* Fig. 3 needs more explanation.,,arg_request,1
"The horizontal axes are unlabelled, and ""margin normalization"" is confusing when shown together with SN without an explanation.",,arg_request,1
Perhaps it's helpful to briefly introduce it in addition to citing Bartlett et al. 2017.,,arg_request,1
* The epsilons in Fig. 5 have very different scales (0 - 0.5 vs. 0 - 5). Are these relevant to the specific algorithms and why?,,arg_request,1
* Section 5.3 (Fig. 6) is the part most relevant to the generalisation problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the results are unconvincing: only the results for epsilon = 0.1 are shown, and even so the advantage is marginal.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore, the baseline models did not use other almost standard regularisation techniques (weight decay, dropout, batch-norm).",,arg_evaluative,0
It is thus unclear whether the advantage can be maintained after applying these standard regularsisers.,,arg_evaluative,0
"A typo in page 6, last line: wth -> with",,arg_request,1
* Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
- The paper gives theoretical insight into why Batch Normalization is useful in making neural network training more robust and is therefore an important contribution to the literature.,,arg_structuring,0
"- While the actual arguments are somewhat technical as is expected from such a paper, the motivation and general strategy is very easy to follow and insightful.",,arg_evaluative,0
* Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
"- The bounds do not immediately apply in the batch normalization setting as used by neural network practitioners, however there are practical ways to link the two settings as pointed out in section 2.4",,arg_evaluative,0
"- As the authors point out, the idea of using a batch-normalization like strategy to set an adaptive learning rate has already been explored in the WNGrad paper.",,arg_structuring,0
However it is valuable to have a similar analysis closer to the batch normalization setting used by most practitioners.,,arg_request,1
"- Currently there is no experimental evaluation of the claims, which would be valuable given that the setting doesn't immediately apply in the normal batch normalization setting.",,arg_request,1
I would like to see evidence that the main benefit from batch normalization indeed comes from picking a good adaptive learning rate.,,arg_request,1
"Overall I recommend publishing the paper as it is a well-written and insightful discussion of batch normalization. Be aware that I read the paper and wrote this review on short notice, so I didn't have time to go through all the arguments in detail.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper introduced a latent space model for reinforcement learning in vision-based control tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
"It first learns a latent dynamics model, in which the transition model and the reward model can be learned on the latent state representations.",,arg_structuring,0
"Using the learned latent state representations, it used an actor-critic model to learn a reactive policy to optimize the agent's behaviors in long-horizon continuous control tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
The method is applied to vision-based continuous control in 20 tasks in the Deepmind control suite.,,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. The method used a latent dynamics model, which avoids reconstruction of the future images during inference.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2. The learned actor-critic model replaced online planning, where actions can be evaluated in a more efficient manner.",,arg_evaluative,0
"3. The model achieved better performances in challenging control tasks compared to previous latent space planning methods, such as PlaNet.",,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
1. The work has limited novelty: the learning of the world model (recurrent state-space model) closely follows the prior work of PlaNet.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In contrast to PlaNet, the difference is that this work learns an actor-critic model in place of online planning with the cross entropy method.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, I found the contribution of the actor-critic model is insufficient and requires additional experimental validation (see below).",,arg_request,1
"2. Since the actor-critic model is the novel component in this model (propagating gradients through the learned dynamics), I would like to see additional analysis and baseline comparisons of this method to previous actor-critic policy learning methods, such as DDPG and SAC training on the (fixed) latent state representations, and recent work of MVE or STEVE that use the learned dynamics to accelerate policy learning with multi-step updates.",,arg_request,1
"3. The world model is fixed while learning the action and value models, meaning that reinforcement learning of the actor-critic model cannot be used to improve the latent state model.",,arg_fact,0
It'd be interesting to see how optimization of the actions would lead to better state representations by propagating gradients from the actor-critic model to the world model.,,arg_request,1

"In this paper, the authors propose a framework for continual learning based on explanations for performed classifications of previously learned tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
"In this framework, an average saliency map is computed for all images in the test set of a previous task to identify image regions, which are important for that task.",,arg_structuring,0
"When learning the next task, this average saliency map is used in an attention mechanism to help learning the new task and to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
"Furthermore, the authors propose a new metric for the goodness of a saliency map by taking into account the number of pixels in the map, the average distance between pixels in the map, as well as the prediction probability given only the salient pixels.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors report that their approach achieves the best average classification accuracy for 3 out of 4 benchmark datasets compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.,,arg_structuring,0

"- the locations for important features should be comparatively stable (for example, one would expect the average saliency map to become fairly meaningless if important features, such as the face of a dog, can appear anywhere in the image.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, an interesting baseline for the evaluation of the ICL approach would be a predefined, fixed attention map consisting of concentric circles with the image center as their center, to show that the proposed approach does more than just deemphasizing the corners of the image)",,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, the authors appear to imply that increased FSM values for an old task after training on a new task indicate catastrophic forgetting.",,arg_fact,0
"While this is a reasonable assumption, it does not necessarily seem to be the case that a larger, more disconnected saliency map indicates worse classification performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Comparatively small changes in FSM may not affect the classification performance at all, while larger changes may not necessarily lead to worse classifications either.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, by increasing the amount or size of image regions to be considered, the classifier may accidentally become more robust on an old task.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, it may be a good idea for the authors to analyze the correlation between FSM changes and accuracy changes.",,arg_request,1
Evaluation:,,arg_structuring,0
The evaluation of the proposed approach on the four used datasets appears to be reasonable and well done.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, given that the achieved performance gains over the state-of-the-art are fairly small, it would be good to assess if the obtained improvements are statistically significant.",,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, it may be informative to show the saliency maps in Figure 5 not only for cases in which the learner classified the image correctly in both time steps, but also cases in which the learner classified the image correctly the first time and incorrectly the second time.",,arg_request,1
"Additionally, the previously mentioned evaluation steps, i.e., using a fixed attention map as baseline for the evaluation and evaluating the correlation between FSM and accuracy may be informative to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.",,arg_request,1
Clarity:,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
One minor issue is that the first sentence of the third paragraph in Section 4 is not a full sentence and therefore difficult to understand.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore, on page 6, it is stated that the surrounding square $\hat{x}_i$ is 15 x 15 pixels, while the size of the square $x_i$ is 10 x 10.",,arg_fact,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"The manuscript proposes a modification of generators in GANs which improves performance under two popular metrics for multiple architectures, loss, benchmarks, regularizers, and hyperparameter settings.",,arg_fact,0
"Using the conditional batch normalization mechanism, the input noise vector is allowed to modulate layers of the generator.",,arg_fact,0
"As this modulation only depends on the noise vector, this technique does not require additional annotations.",,arg_fact,0
"In addition to the extensive experimentation on different settings showing performance improvements, the authors also present an ablation study, that shows the impact of the method when applied to different layers.",,arg_fact,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
- The idea is simple.,,arg_evaluative,0
The experimentation is extensive and results are convincing in that they show a clear improvement in performance using the method in a large majority of settings.,,arg_evaluative,0
- I also like the ablation study showing the impact of the method applied at different layers.,,arg_evaluative,0
Requests for clarification/additional information:,,arg_structuring,0
"- I might have missed that, but are the authors offering an interpretation of their observation that the performance of the self-modulation model performs worse in the combination of spectral normalization and the SNDC architecture?",,arg_request,1
- The ablation study shows that the impact is highest when modulation is applied to the last layer (if only one layer is modulated).,,arg_fact,0
It seems modulation on layer 4 comes in as a close second.,,arg_fact,0
I am curious about why that might be.,,arg_request,1
- I would like to see some more interpretation on why this method works.,,arg_request,1
- Did the authors inspect generated samples of the baseline and the proposed method? Is there a notable qualitative difference?,,arg_request,1
"Overall, the idea is simple, the explanation is clear and experimentation is extensive. I would like to see more commentary on why this method might have long-term impact (or not).",,arg_request,1

The authors need to be clear about their contribution. Is the paper only about replacing the traditional parametric functions of influence and probability with  deep neural networks?,,arg_request,1
The experimental sections look rather mechanical. I would have put some results on the learned embedding. Or some demonstration of the embedded history or probability to intuitively convey the idea and how it works.,,arg_request,1

The paper proposes two additional steps to improve the compression of weights in deep neural networks.,,arg_structuring,0
"The first is to quantize the weights after pruning, and the second is to further encode the quantized weights.",,arg_structuring,0
There are several weaknesses in this paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
The first one is clarity.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper is not very self-contained, and I have to constantly go back to Lee et al. and Xu et al. in order to read through the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper can be made more mathematically precise.,,arg_request,1
The input and output types of each block in Figure 1. should be clearly stated.,,arg_request,1
"For example, in Section 3.2, it can be made clear that the domain of the quantization function is the real and the codomain is a sequence k bits.",,arg_request,1
"Since the paper relies so heavily on Lee et al., the authors should make an effort to summarize the approach in a mathematically precise way.",,arg_request,1
"The figures are almost useless, because the captions contain very little information.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, the authors should at least say that the ""D"" in Figure 2. stands for delay, and the underline in Figure 4. indicates the bits that are not pruned.",,arg_evaluative,0
Many more can be said in all the figures.,,arg_evaluative,0
The second weakness is experimental design.,,arg_evaluative,0
There are two conflicting qualities that need to be optimized--performance and compression rate.,,arg_fact,0
"When optimizing the compression rate, it is important not to look at the test set error.",,arg_evaluative,0
"If the compression rate is optimized on the test set, then the compressed model is nothing but a model overfit to the test set.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The test set is typically small compared to the training set, so it is no surprise that the compression rate can be as high as 90%.",,arg_fact,0
Optimizing compression rates should be done on the training set with a separate development set.,,arg_evaluative,0
The test set should not used before the best compression scheme is selected.,,arg_evaluative,0
Both the results on the development set and on the test set should be reported for the validity of the experiments.,,arg_request,1
"I do not see these experimental settings mentioned anywhere in the paper, and this is very concerning.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Lee et al. seem to make similar mistakes, and it is likely that their experimental design is also flawed.",,arg_evaluative,0
I read the other reviewers' comments as well as the rebuttal.,,arg_social,0
"I think that the other reviewers make a number of valid points, especially with regards to the theoretical analysis of the paper.",,arg_social,0

Paper 93 proposes an empirical evaluation of the memorization properties of convnets.,,arg_structuring,0
"More specifically, it evaluates three aspects:",,arg_structuring,0
-,,arg_structuring,0
First it evaluates whether convnets can learn to distinguish images from two different sets by training a binary classifier.,,arg_structuring,0
"The conclusion is that, indeed, deep convnets can learn to make such a decision. As could be guessed from intuition, the larger the capacity of the network and the smaller the size of the sets, the higher the accuracy.",,arg_structuring,0
-,,arg_structuring,0
"Second, it evaluates whether we can detect that a group of samples of a dataset was used to train a model.",,arg_structuring,0
"For this purpose, it is proposed to compute the distribution of maximal activation scores of the output softmax layer and to make use of the Kolmogorov-Smirov distance between the cumulative distributions.",,arg_structuring,0
It is shown experimentally that one can detect (even partial) leakage with such a technique.,,arg_structuring,0
-,,arg_structuring,0
"Third, it evaluates whether we can detect that a single images was used to train a convnet.",,arg_structuring,0
Two simple techniques are proposed.,,arg_structuring,0
The first one considers that a sample is part of the training set if it correctly classified.,,arg_structuring,0
The second one considers that a sample is part of the training set if its loss is below a threshold.,,arg_structuring,0
It is shown experimentally that one can make such a decision with moderate accuracy.,,arg_structuring,0
On the positive side:,,arg_structuring,0
-	This is a topic that should be of broad interest to the ICLR community.,,arg_evaluative,0
-	The paper is generally well-written.,,arg_evaluative,0
-	The experiments are reported on large-scale datasets on high-capacity networks which is more realistic than small-scale settings.,,arg_evaluative,0
On the negative side:,,arg_structuring,0
-,,arg_structuring,0
It is unclear whether the data augmentation techniques is applied only at training time or also at test time.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In other words: at test time, do you present the original images only or transformed images too?",,arg_request,1
"-	In section 4, it is unclear why only the maximal activation of the softmax layer is used to characterize a sample? Why not considering the full distribution that should contain richer information? Why just focusing on the output layer and why not using the info available at intermediate layers?",,arg_request,1
-	Section 5 is somewhat less clear than the previous sections.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors should more clearly define what the private, public and evaluation sets are, right from the beginning.",,arg_request,1
The purpose of the public set is explained only in section 5.2.,,arg_evaluative,0
-	The experimental results of section 5.2 are somewhat disappointing.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Even with no data augmentation, and even with the original networks, membership can only be assessed with a 90% accuracy.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Results are much lower in less favorable cases, sometimes close to random (see last line of Table 3).",,arg_evaluative,0
This seems to be too low to be of practical use.,,arg_evaluative,0
This might be because the Bayes and MAT attacks are too simplistic.,,arg_evaluative,0

"However, the paper does cover a setup that I am not aware that was studied before.",,arg_evaluative,0

"This paper proposes a new method to compare existing classifiers, which does not use fixed test set and adaptively sample it from an arbitrarily large corpus of unlabeled images.",,arg_structuring,0
The main idea seems similar to adopting active learning for the test set selection.,,arg_structuring,0
One of the main advantage is that it can select a sample set from an arbitrarily large unlabeled images.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, to compare different classifiers, the proposed algorithm still needs humans to annotate the selected dataset, which is very expensive compared with traditional methods.",,arg_fact,0
"Since this paper select the top-k images in D, if k is large the annotating for S will be very tedious, however if k is relatively small the method seems very sensitive to selected examples, which will make the comparison not totally convincing.",,arg_evaluative,0

"This work is an interesting application of deep learning, but it gives little insight as to why deep networks are able to solve the problem and how to solve ordinal embedding itself.",,arg_evaluative,0

The authors propose a notion of conductance to attribute the deep neural network’s prediction to its hidden units.,,arg_structuring,0
The conductance is the flow of attribution via the hidden unit(s) in consideration.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper proposes using conductance to not only evaluate importance of hidden unit to the prediction for a specific input but also over a set of inputs.,,arg_structuring,0
The strongest part of the analysis of conductance is that conductance naturally couples  the path at the base features with that of the hidden layer.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors position their work well within the existing approaches in the community and generalizes the efficient use of measuring hidden activation wrt to specific input or set of inputs.,,arg_evaluative,0
The analysis makes efficient use of mean value theorem in the context of  parametrization of the loss function.,,arg_evaluative,0
Conductance seems to satisfy the completeness of hidden features.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Further, it also satisfies the layer-wise conservation principle with the outputs completely redistributed  to the inputs.",,arg_evaluative,0
It would be good to see more analysis on the axioms 1 through to 4 for the sake of completeness in the light of partial axiomatization of conductance.,,arg_request,1
The authors provide empirical evaluation of conductance over a variety of tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0

Algorithms for Streaming data using a machine learning oracle is analyzed theoretically and empirically.,,arg_structuring,0
The idea is to build on some recent work (Hsu 19) which used RNNs to predict heavy hitters in streaming data.,,arg_structuring,0
The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether such an oracle can help streaming algorithms to obtain improved bounds.,,arg_evaluative,0
I am not very familiar with this line of research so my comments will be more general in this case.,,arg_fact,0
The idea of improved bounds for streaming algorithms using machine learning oracle seems to be very appealing to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors present novel theoretical results supporting this.,,arg_evaluative,0
Experiments are performed on real as well as synthetic datasets using Hsu et al.’s method as an oracle.,,arg_evaluative,0

"One issue is perhaps, very little in terms of related work.",,arg_request,1

The paper paper proposes a mutual information maximization objective for discovering unsupervised robotic manipulation skills.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper assumes that the state space can be divided into two parts - the state of the robot (“context states”) which is controllable via actions and the state of an object (“states of interest”) which must be manipulated by the robot.,,arg_structuring,0
"Given these two categories of states, the proposed algorithm maximizes a lower bound on the mutual information between the two categories of states such that a policy is learnt that is able to manipulate the object with the robot meaningfully.",,arg_structuring,0
"I vote for weak reject as (1) the paper makes a strong assumption about the availability of both the robot and object states which is not realistic in typical robotic manipulation applications and (2) the objective in the paper will not work if there is no notion of an “object” or object-state e.g.: this algorithm will not learn skills for a robot trying to control itself; hence, it is not truly a general purpose skill discovery algorithm but rather a skill discovery algorithm specifically meant for robot-object manipulation tasks.",,arg_evaluative,0
My main concern with the paper is its limited applicability to robotic manipulation tasks with a clear divide between states of interest vs others.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper does not talk about settings where states of interest are not known, so all of the experiments are based on this strong assumption.",,arg_evaluative,0
It doesn’t seem like a surprising discovery that maximizing the mutual information between the robot state and object state will lead to skills that actually make the robot move the object.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Given that object manipulation is the specific application of interest, the comparison with DIAYN and the combined objective with DIAYN is interesting but little motivation or discussion has been provided in the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
Can the authors elaborate on why this choice should intuitively be better than the proposed method alone?,,arg_request,1
"The paper does not talk about how these skills can be used as primitive actions by a higher level controller (in a hierarchical RL setup), which would help in demonstrating the usefulness of these skills - e.g.: are these skills sequentially composable such that they can solve a complex task?",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposed a novel image classifier comparison approach that went beyond one fixed testing set for all.,,arg_structuring,0
"Instead, for a pair of classifiers to be compared, it advocated to sample their ""most disagreed"" test set from a large corpus of unlabeled images.",,arg_structuring,0

"Because of the efficacy of such ""worst-case"" comparison, the needed set size is very small and thus minimizes the human annotation workload.",,arg_structuring,0
The proposed MAD competition distinguishes classifiers by finding their respective counterexamples.,,arg_structuring,0
"It is therefore an ""error spotting"" mechanism, rather than a drop-in replacement of standard test accuracy.",,arg_structuring,0

"If that is true, I would suggest the authors to make this hidden assumption clearer in the paper",,arg_request,1
"The idea shows clear liaison to the ""differential testing"" concept in software engineering besides the cited work of perceptual quality assessment.",,arg_fact,0
The idea has a cross-disciplinary nature and is fairly interesting to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
I can see the paper to be of interest to a quite broad audience and can motivate many subsequent works.,,arg_evaluative,0
"One minor comment: for images in ""Case III"", the authors considered them ""contribute little to performance comparison between the two classifiers"" and therefore did not source labels for them.",,arg_structuring,0

1. The observation that gradients explode in spite of BN is quite counter-intuitive. Can you give an intuitive explanation of why this occurs?,,arg_request,1
"2. In a similar vein, there a number of highly technical results in the paper and it would be great if the authors provide an intuitive explanation of their theorems.",,arg_request,1
3. Can the statistics of activations be controlled using activation functions or operations which break the symmetry?,,arg_request,1
"For instance, are BSB1 fixed points good for training neural networks?",,arg_request,1
"4. Mean field analysis, although it lends an insight into the statistics of the activations, needs to connected with empirical observations.",,arg_request,1
"For instance, when the authors observe that the structure of the fixed point is such that activations are of identical norm equally spread apart in terms of angle, this is quite far from practice.",,arg_fact,0
It would be good to mention this in the introduction or the conclusions.,,arg_request,1
"This paper shows that Hamiltonian gradient descent (HGD), which is gradient descent on the norm of the squared norm of the vector field, achieves linear convergence for a broader range of problems than bilinear and convex-strongly concave formulations.",,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, the authors show the result for convex-concave problems satisfying a “sufficiently bilinear” condition that is related to the PL conditions.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, the authors argue that consensus optimization (CO) can be viewed as a perturbation of HGD when the parameter choice is big enough.",,arg_structuring,0
From this viewpoint they derive convergence rates for CO on the broader set of problems.,,arg_structuring,0
This provides some further theoretical justification of the success of CO on large scale GAN problems.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper is presented in a clear manner, with the objectives and analysis techniques delineated in the main paper.",,arg_structuring,0
This was helpful to get a sense of the main points before going through the appendix.,,arg_structuring,0
"The objective of the paper is to extend the problem settings for which there is last iterate min-max convergence rates, which now exist for bilinear, strongly convex-strongly concave, and convex-strongly concave problems.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors achieve this by analyzing HGD and giving convergence rates for when a “sufficiently bilinear condition is satisfied”.,,arg_structuring,0
The primary idea behind the proof techniques is to show that the objective (Hamiltonian) satisfies the PL condition.,,arg_structuring,0
I found this to be an interesting approach.,,arg_structuring,0
"As a result, the main question in evaluating this paper is on the significance of the result and the generality of the “sufficiently bilinear” condition.",,arg_structuring,0
I tend to lean toward the result carrying some significance since it does extend the class of problems for which the convergence rates exists.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the weakness is that the condition is opaque and it is not entirely clear how broad of class of problems this condition would apply to.",,arg_evaluative,0
I do acknowledge that the authors did a reasonable job of trying to clear this up in section 3.2 and section G of the appendix.,,arg_evaluative,0
It did still leave me wanting more with respect to the practical significance though.,,arg_fact,0
"Finally, I found the connection to CO valuable.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, since this paper does not show large-scale experiments, the connection serves to provide some more theoretical evidence for they CO performs well in practice.",,arg_evaluative,0
Post Author Response: Thanks for the response. I agree with your perspective and think this paper should be accepted.,,arg_social,0
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper proposes a suite of tricks for training large-scale GANs, and obtaining state-of-the-art results for high-resolution images.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper starts from a self-attention GAN baseline (Zhang 2018), and proposes:",,arg_structuring,0
-	Increasing batch size (8x) and model size (2x),,arg_other,0
"-	Splitting noise z in multiple chunks, and injecting it in multiple layers of the generator",,arg_structuring,0
-,,arg_structuring,0
"Sampling from truncated normal distribution, where samples with norms that exceed a specific threshold are resampled.",,none,0
This seems to be used only at test-time and is used to control variety-fidelity tradeoff.,,arg_structuring,0
The generator is encouraged to be smooth using an orthogonal regularization term.,,arg_structuring,0
"In addition, the paper proposes practical recipes for characterizing collapse in GANs.",,arg_structuring,0
"In the generator, the exploding of the top 3 singular values of each weight matrix seem to indicate collapse.",,arg_structuring,0
"In the discriminator, the sudden increase of the ratio of first/second singular value of weight matrices indicate collapse in GANs.",,arg_structuring,0
"Interestingly, the paper suggests that various regularization methods which can improve stability in GAN training, do not necessarily correspond to improvement in performance.",,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
-	Proposed techniques are intuitive and very well motivated,,arg_evaluative,0
"-	One of the big pluses of this work is that authors try to ""quantify"" each proposed technique with training speed and/or performance improvement. This is really a good practice.",,arg_evaluative,0
-	Detailed analysis for detecting collapse and improving stability in large-scale GAN,,arg_evaluative,0
"-	Probably no need to mention that, but results are quite impressive",,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
-	Computational budget required is massive.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper mentions model use from 128-256 TPUs, which severely limits reproducibility of results.",,arg_evaluative,0
Comments/Questions:,,arg_structuring,0
-	Can you elaborate more on why BatchNorm statistics are computed across all devices as opposed to per-device? Was this crucial for best performance?,,arg_request,1
-	It is not clear if provided analysis for large-scale GANs apply for small-medium sized GANs.,,arg_request,1
Providing such analysis would be also helpful for the community.,,arg_request,1
"-	How do you see the impact of the suggested techniques on tackling harder data-modalities for GANs, e.g. text or sequential data in general?",,arg_request,1
Overall recommendation:,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper is well written, ideas are well motivated/justified and results are very compelling.",,arg_evaluative,0
This is a good paper and I higly recommend acceptance.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The author's present a dual learning framework that, instead of using a single mapping for each mapping task between two respective domains, the authors learn multiple diverse mappings.",,arg_structuring,0
These diverse mappings are learned before the two main mappings are trained and are kept constant during the training of the two main mappings.,,arg_structuring,0
"Though I am not familiar with BLEU scores and though I didn't grasp some of the details in 3.1, the algorithm yielded consistent improvement over the given baselines.",,arg_structuring,0
The author's included many different experiments to show this.,,arg_structuring,0
The idea that multiple mappings will produce better results than a single mapping is reasonable given previous results on ensemble methods.,,arg_structuring,0
"For the language translation results, were there any other state-of-the-art methods that the authors could compare against? It seems they are only comparing against their own implementations.",,arg_request,1
Objectively saying that the author's method is better than CycleGAN is difficult. How does their ensemble method compare to just their single-agent dual method? Is there a noticeable difference there?,,arg_request,1
Minor Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
Dual-1 and Dual-5 are introduced without explanation.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Perhaps I missed it, but I believe Dan Ciresan's paper ""Multi-Column Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification"" should be cited.",,arg_request,1
###,,arg_structuring,0
After reading author feedback,,none,0
Thank you for the feedback.,,arg_social,0
After reading the updated paper I still believe that 6 is the right score for this paper.,,arg_fact,0
The method produces better results using ensemble learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"While the results seem impressive, the method to obtain them is not very novel; nonetheless, I would not have a problem with it being accepted, but I don't think it would be a loss if it were not accepted.",,arg_fact,0
The authors propose a new on-policy exploration strategy by using a policy with a hierarchy of stochasticity.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors use a two-level hierarchical distribution as a policy, where the global variable is used for dropout.",,arg_structuring,0
This work is interesting since the authors use dropout for policy learning and exploration.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors show that parameter noise exploration is a particular case of the proposed policy.,,arg_structuring,0
The main concern is the gap between the problem formulation and the actual optimization problem in Eq 12.,,arg_structuring,0
I am very happy to give a higher rating if the authors address the following points.,,arg_structuring,0
Detailed Comments,,arg_structuring,0
(1) The authors give the derivation for Eq 10.,,arg_fact,0
"However, it is not obvious that how to move from line 3 to line 4 at Eq 15.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Minor:  Since the action is denoted by ""a"",  it will be more clear if the authors use another symbol to denote the parameter of q(z) instead of ""\alpha"" at Eq 10 and 15.",,arg_request,1
"(2) Due to the use of the likelihood ratio trick, the authors use the mean policy as an approximation at Eq 12.",,arg_fact,0
Does such approximation guarantee the policy improvement?,,arg_request,1
Any justification?,,arg_request,1
"(3) Instead of using the mean policy approximation in Eq 12, the authors should consider existing Monte Carlo techniques to reduce the variance of the gradient estimation.",,arg_request,1
"For example, [1] could be used to reduce the variance of gradient w.r.t. \phi.",,arg_request,1
Note that the gradient is biased if the mean policy approximation is used.,,arg_fact,0
(4) Are \theta and \phi jointly and simultaneously optimized at Eq 12?,,arg_request,1
The authors should clarify this point.,,arg_request,1
"(5) Due to the mean policy approximation, does the mean policy depend on \phi?",,arg_request,1
The authors should clearly explain how to update \phi when optimizing Eq 12.,,arg_request,1
"(6) If the authors jointly and simultaneously optimize \theta and \phi, why a regularization term about q_{\phi}(z)  is missing in Eq 12 while a regularization term about \pi_{\theta|z} does appear in Eq 12?",,arg_request,1
"(7) The authors give the derivations about \theta such as the gradient and the regularization term about \theta (see, Eq 18-19).",,arg_fact,0
"However, the derivations about \phi are missing.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, how to compute the gradient w.r.t. \phi? Since the mean policy is used, it is not apparent that how to compute the gradient w.r.t. \phi.",,arg_request,1
"Minor, 1/2 is missing in the last line of Eq 19.",,arg_request,1

[Summary],,arg_structuring,0
The paper presents a video classification framework that employs 4D convolution to capture longer term temporal structure than the popular 3D convolution schemes.,,arg_structuring,0
This is achieved by treating the compositional space of local 3D video snippets as an individual dimension where an individual convolution is applied.,,arg_structuring,0
"The 4D convolution is integrated in resnet blocks and implemented via first applying 3D convolution to regular spatio-temporal video volumes and then the compositional space convolution, to leverage existing 3D operators.",,arg_structuring,0
Empirical evaluation on three benchmarks against other baselines suggested the advantage of the proposed method.,,arg_structuring,0
[Decision],,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, the paper addresses an important problem in computer vision (video action recognition) with an interesting.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I found the motivation and solution are reasonable (despite some questions pending more elaboration), and results also look promising, thus give it a weak accept (conditional on the answers though).",,arg_evaluative,0
[Comments],,arg_structuring,0
"At the conceptual level, the idea of jointly modeling local video events is not novel, and can date back to at least ten years ago in the paper “Learning realistic human actions from movies”, where the temporal pyramid matching was combined with the bag-of-visual-words framework to capture long-term temporal structure.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The problem with this strategy is that the rigid composition only works for actions that can be split into consecutive temporal parts with prefixed duration and anchor points in time, which is clearly challenged by many works later when more complicated video events are studied.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It seems to me that the proposed framework also falls in this category, with a treatment from deep learning.",,none,0
It is definitely worth some discussion on this path.,,none,0
"That said, I would like to see more analysis on the behavior of the proposed method under various interesting cases not tested yet.",,arg_request,1
"Despite the claim that the proposed method can capture long-term video patterns, the static compositional nature seems to work best for activities with well-defined local events and clear temporal boundaries.",,arg_fact,0
"These assumptions hold mostly true for the three datasets used in the experiment, and also are suggested by results in table 2(e), where 3 parts are necessary to achieve optimal results.",,arg_fact,0
How does the proposed method perform in more complicated tasks such as,,arg_request,1
"- action detection or localization (e.g., in benchmarks JHMDB or UCF101-24).",,none,0
"- complex video event modeling (e.g., recognizing activities in extended video of TRECVID).",,none,0
Will it still be more favorable than other concerning baselines?,,arg_request,1
"Besides, on the computation side, it would be complexity, an explicit comparison of complexity makes it easier to evaluate the performance when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",,arg_fact,0
[Area to improve],,arg_structuring,0
"Better literature review to reflect the relevant previous video action recognitions, especially those on video compositional models.",,arg_evaluative,0

"- The word in the title should be “Convolutional”, right?",,arg_request,1
This paper describes the method for performing self-training where the unlabeled datapoints are iteratively added to the training set only if their predictions by the classifier are confident enough.,,arg_structuring,0
The contributions of this paper are to add datapoints based on the prediction of the confidence level by a separate selection network and a number of heuristics applied for better selection.,,arg_fact,0
"On the experimental side, the contribution is to test the scenario where datapoints from irrelevant classes are included in the unlabeled dataset.",,arg_fact,0
"The paper is written in a way that makes following it a bit difficult, for example, the experimental setups.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, the writing can be improved by making the writing more concise and formal (examples of informal: ""spoil the network"", ""model is spoiled"", ""problem of increased classes"", ""many recent researches have been conducted"", ""lots of things to consider for training"", ""supervised learning was trained"" etc.).",,arg_request,1
The contributions of the method could also be underlined more clearly in the abstract and introduction.,,arg_request,1
The description of consistency regularisation methods in section 2.2 is not very clear and I would like to get better understanding of temporal ensembling and SNTG methods here as they play an important role in the experiments.,,arg_evaluative,0
The idea of selective sampling for self-training is promising and the investigated questions are interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
"As far as I understand, the main contribution of this paper is the use of separate ""selection network"" to estimate the confidence of predictions by ""classification network"".",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, as the ""selection network"" uses exactly the same input as ""classification network"", it is hard to imagine how it can learn additional information.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, imagine the case of binary classification.",,arg_other,0
"If the selection network predicts 0 in come cases, it can be used to improve the result of ""classification network"" by flipping the corresponding label.",,arg_fact,0
How can you interpret such a thought experiment?,,arg_request,1
"One could understand the use of ""selection network"" as a way to automatically select a threshold of what to consider confident, however, in this case, the prediction of ""selection network"" should be thresholded at 0.5 (correct prediction or not), but the experiments use complex thresholds.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Could you elaborate more on why the selection network is needed? How would it compare to a simple strategy of only including the datapoints whose top-1 prediction of ""classification network"" is greater than some threshold?",,arg_request,1
"Finally, could you show a plot of top-1 prediction of ""classification network"" vs score of ""selection network"" and elaborate on that?",,arg_request,1
"Then, in sections 3.2 and 3.3 the authors introduce a few additional tricks for self-training: exclude datapoints whose predictions are changing and balance the classes.",,arg_fact,0
"Intuitively, these criteria are well motivated, but unfortunately, the combination of all the intuitions (including ""selection network"" with threshold) is not very principled.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Ablation study shows that the use of the ""selection network"" strategy does not improve the results without these heuristics.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would be interesting to see how these heuristics would do without ""selection network"", for example, either by doing simple self-training with thresholding on the score of the classifier or by applying only these heuristics in combination with TempEns+SNTG.",,arg_request,1
"In the current form of evaluation, it is hard to say if there is any benefit of using the ""selection network"" that is the main novelty of the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is very valuable that the experimental results include many recently proposed methods.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides, the settings are described in details that could help for the reproducibility of the results.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I have a few concerns about the results.",,arg_evaluative,0
"First of all, the proposed SST algorithm alone only performs better than baselines in 1 case, equal to them in 1 case and worse in 1 (table 3).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides, as the base classifier is different for various baselines, it is hard to compare the methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Then, the important hyperparameter of the method---threshold---seems to be hard to select (both in sections 4.1 and 4.2).",,arg_evaluative,0
How did you chose the current values? How sensitive is it? Why various datasets need different settings? How the threshold value can be set in practice?,,arg_request,1
Another important parameters is the number of iterations of the algorithm.,,arg_request,1
How was it chosen?,,arg_request,1
"Concerning the experiments of section 4.2, how would the baseline methods of section 4.1 do in this case? Why did you select to study animal vs non-animals sets of classes?",,arg_request,1
What would happen if you use random class splits or split animal classes (like in a more realistic scenario)?,,arg_request,1
"To conclude, while I find the studied problem quite interesting and intuitions behind the method very reasonable, the current methodology is not very principled and the experiment evaluation did not convince me that such an elaborate strategy is needed.",,arg_structuring,0
Some questions and comments:,,arg_structuring,0
- The setting of including unrelated classes in the unlabeled data resembles transfer learning setting. Could you explain why the ideas from transfer learning are not applicable in your case?,,arg_request,1
"- In the training procedure of ""selection network"" of Sections 3.1, do you use the same datapoints to train a ""classification network"" and ""selection network""? If it is the case, how do you insure that the ""classification network"" does not learn to fit the data perfectly and thus all labels s_i are 1?",,arg_request,1
"- In the last sentences of the first paragraph on p.2 you make a contrast between using softmax and sigmoid functions, however, normally the difference between them is their use in binary or multiclass classification. Is there anything special that you want to show in you case?",,arg_request,1
"- What do you mean in section 3.3 by ""if one class dominates the dataset, the model tends to overfit""?",,arg_request,1
- I think parameters of training the networks from the beginning of section 4 could be moved to the supplementary materials.,,arg_request,1
- Figure 3: wouldn't the plot of accuracy vs amount of data be more suitable here?,,arg_request,1
- Synthetic experiments of supplementary materials: the gains of the methods seem to be small. What are the numerical results? What would happen if you allow to select starting point at random (a more realistic case)?,,arg_request,1
"- Can you explain the sentence ""To prevent data being added suddenly, no data was added until 5 iterations""?",,arg_request,1
- How was it possible to improve the performance in experiment of section 4.2 with 100% of irrelevant classes?,,arg_request,1
This paper proposes to extend VAE-GAN from the static image generation setting to the video generation setting.,,arg_structuring,0
"It’s a well-written, simple paper that capitalizes on the trade-off between model realism and diversity, and the fact that VAEs and GANs (at least empirically) tend to lie on different sides of this spectrum.",,arg_evaluative,0
The idea to extend the use of VAE-GANs to the video prediction setting is a pretty natural one and not especially novel.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the effort to implement it successfully is commendable and will, I think, serve as a good reference for future work on video prediction.",,arg_evaluative,0
There are also several interesting design choices that I think are worth of further exposition.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Why, for example, did the authors only perform variational inference with the current and previous frames? Did conditioning on additional frames offer limited further improvement? Can the blurriness instead be attributable to the weak inference model?",,arg_request,1
Please provide a response to these questions.,,arg_social,0
"If the authors have any ablation studies to back up their design choices, that would also be much appreciated, and will make this a more valuable paper for readers.",,arg_request,1
I think Figure 5 is the most interesting figure in the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
I would imagine that playing with the hyperparameters would allow one to traverse the trade-off between realism and diversity.,,arg_fact,0
I think having such a curve will help sell the paper as giving the practitioner the freedom to select their own preferred trade-off.,,arg_fact,0
I don’t understand the claim that “GANs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels over per-pixel reconstruction” and its implication that VAEs do not prioritize joint distribution matching.,,arg_evaluative,0
"VAEs prioritize matching joint distributions of pixels and latent space: min KL(q(z, x) || p(z, x)) and is a variational approximation of the problem min KL(q(x) || p(x)), where q(x) is the data distribution.",,arg_fact,0
The explanation provided by the authors is thus not sufficiently precise and I recommend the retraction of this claim.,,arg_evaluative,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
+ Well-written,,arg_evaluative,0
+ Natural extension of VAE-GANs to video prediction setting,,arg_evaluative,0
+ Establishes a good baseline for future video prediction work,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
- Limited novelty,,arg_evaluative,0
- Limited analysis of model/architecture design choices,,arg_evaluative,0
Summary: The paper focuses on comparing the impact of explicit modularity and structure on systematic generalization by studying neural modular networks and “generic” models.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper studies one instantiation of this systematic generalization for the setting of binary “yes” or “no” visual question answering task.,,arg_structuring,0
They introduce a new dataset called in which model has to answer questions that require spatial reasoning about pairs of randomly scattered letters and digits in the image.,,arg_structuring,0
"While the models are evaluated on all possible object pairs, they are trained on a smaller subset.",,arg_structuring,0
They observe that NMNs generalize better than other neural models when an appropriate choice of layout and parametrization is made.,,arg_structuring,0
They also show that current end-to-end approaches for inducing model layout or learning model parametrization fail to generalize better than generic models.,,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
- The conclusions of the paper regarding the generalization ability of neural modular networks is timely given the widespread interest in these class of algorithms.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- Additionally, they present interesting observations regarding how sensitive NMNs are to the layout of models.",,arg_evaluative,0
Experimental evidence (albeit on specific type of question) of this behaviour will be helpful for the community and hopefully motivate them to incorporate regularizers or priors that steer the learning towards better layouts.,,arg_fact,0
- The authors provide a nice summary of all the models analyzed in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"- While the results on SQOOP dataset are interesting, it would have been very exciting to see results on other synthetic datasets.",,arg_request,1
"Specifically, there are two datasets which are more complex and uses templated language to generate synthetic datasets similar to this paper:",,arg_structuring,0
- CLEVR environment or a modification of that dataset to reflect the form of systematic the authors are studying in the paper.,,arg_fact,0
"- Abstract Scenes VQA dataset introduced in“Yin and Yang: Balancing and Answering Binary Visual Questions” by Zhang and Goyal et al. They provide a balanced dataset in which there are a pairs of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is “yes” for one scene, and “no” for the other for the exact same question.",,arg_fact,0
"- Perhaps because the authors study a very specific kind of question, they limit their analysis to only three modules and two structures (tree & chain).",,arg_structuring,0
"However, in the most general setting NMN will form a DAG and it would have been interesting to see what form of DAGs generalize better than other.",,arg_request,1
"- It is not clear to me how the analysis done in this paper will generalize to other more complex datasets where the network layout NMN might be more complex, the number of modules and type of modules might also be more.",,arg_request,1
"Because, the results are only shown on one dataset, it is harder to see how one might extend this work to other form of questions on slightly harder datasets.",,arg_evaluative,0
Other Questions / Remarks:,,arg_structuring,0
"- Given that the accuracy drop is very significant moving from NMN-Tree to NMN-Chain, is there an explanation for this drop?",,arg_request,1
"- While the authors mention multiple times that #rhs/#lhs = 1 and 2 are more challenging than #rhs/#lhs=18, they do not sufficiently explain why this is the case anywhere in the paper.",,arg_request,1

This paper proposed to use dropout to randomly choose only a subset of neural network as a potential way to perform exploration.,,arg_structuring,0
"The dropout happens at the beginning of each episode, and thus leads to a temporally consistent exploration.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper shows that with small amount of Gaussian multiplicative dropout, the algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art results on benchmark environments.",,arg_structuring,0
And it can significantly outperform vanilla PPO for environments with sparse rewards.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is clearly written.,,arg_evaluative,0
The introduced technique is interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I wonder except for the difference of memory consumption, how different it is compared to parameter space exploration.",,arg_request,1
I feel that it is a straightforward extension/generalization of the parameter space exploration. But the stochastic alignment and policy space constraint seem novel and important.,,arg_evaluative,0
The motivation of this paper is mostly about learning with sparse reward.,,arg_fact,0
I am curious whether the paper has other good side effects.,,arg_request,1
"For example, will the dropout cause the policy to be more robust?",,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, If I deploy the learning algorithm on a physical robot, will the temporally consistent exploration cause less wear and tear to the actuators when the robot explores.",,arg_request,1
"In addition, I would like to see some discussions whether this technique could be applied to off-policy learning as well.",,arg_request,1
"Overall, I like this paper. It is well written.",,arg_evaluative,0
The method seems technically sound and achieves good results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For this reason, I would recommend accepting this paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper proposed a general method for image restoration based on GAN.,,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, the latent variable z is optimized based on the MAP framework.",,arg_structuring,0
And the results are obtained by G(z).,,arg_structuring,0
This method looks reasonable to achieve good results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the idea is very related to Yeh et al.’s work which has already published but not mentioned at all.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Yeh, Raymond A., et al. ""Image Restoration with Deep Generative Models."" 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2018.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Both the proposed method and Yeh et al.’s method optimize the latent variable z of the generator using MAP, although the loss functions are slightly different.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In addition, the applications are very similar: image inpainting, denoising, super-resolution etc. Yeh et al.’s method should be the right baseline instead of the nearest neighbor algorithm.",,arg_request,1
"In addition, the results seem very weak.",,arg_evaluative,0
"There are tons of algorithms for image inpainting, denoising, and super-resolution, but the proposed method was not compared with them.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper claims that only the nearest neighbor algorithm can handle different degradations.,,arg_evaluative,0
This is not true.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, total variation regularization can do all these tasks.",,arg_fact,0
"Some other comments: what are the parameters of the degradation in the applications? For example, in image inpainting, does the proposed method learn the mask as well? So it is blind inpainting?",,arg_request,1
The paper presents a way to learn a vectorial representation for items which are only described by triplet similiarity expressions.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper not only claims 'large scale representation learning' but also utilizing the described idea to use neural networks to ""directly, approximately solve non-convex NP-hard optimization problems that arise naturally in unsupervised learning problems."" Both claims are not really shown in the paper: (i) The experiments are not large scale and (ii)  it becomes not clear how any substantiate insight with respect to NP-hard problems can be gained here apart from the fact that it tackles a ML problem, which many seem to be computationally hard problems.",,arg_evaluative,0
As such the paper is not convincing.,,arg_evaluative,0
On a more detailed level it is not clear why the log n representation for items is choosen -- why not just map to embeddings directly?,,arg_request,1
"The more interesting question of how to generalize to unseen items (how would that be possible given that items have no representation at all) is not discussed at all and seems not to be realizable, which makes the starting point of such methods (items have no representation) questionable.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper also misses relevant citations of similar questions from the field of (probabilistic) matrix factorization and relational learning.,,arg_evaluative,0
1. I had hard time to understand latent canonicalization.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Do you mean that each latent variable is fixed to a value, such that this factor of variation is disabled? Are the canonicalizers pre-specified using meta-labels? Are they updated/learned during model training?",,arg_request,1

* Summary,,arg_structuring,0
The paper proposes an improved method for computing derivatives of the expectation.,,arg_structuring,0
Such problems arises with many probabilistic models with noises or latent variables.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper proposes a new gradient estimator of low variance applicable in certain scenarios, in particular it allows training of generative models in which observations and/or latent variables are discrete.",,arg_structuring,0
"The submission clearly improves the state-of-the-art, experimentally demonstrates the method on several problems comparing with the alternative techniques.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In what concerns the optimization, the method achieves a better objective value much faster, confirming that it is a lower variance gradient estimator.",,arg_evaluative,0
The clarity of the presentation (in particular the description of when the method is applicable) and the technical correctness of the paper are somewhat lacking.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In terms of applicability, it seems that many cases where discrete latent variables would be really interesting are not covered (e.g. sigmoid belief networks); the paper demonstrates experiments with discrete images (binary or 4-bit) not particularly motivated in my opinion.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It also contains lots of additional technical details and experiments in the appendix, which I unfortunately did not review.",,arg_evaluative,0

Clarity,,arg_structuring,0
In the abstract the paper promises more than it delivers.,,arg_evaluative,0
Many problems can be cast as optimizing an expectation-based objective.,,arg_evaluative,0
The result does not at all apply to all of them.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The reparameterization trick does not apply to all continuous random variables, only to such that the reparameterization satisfies certain smoothness conditions.",,arg_evaluative,0
Discrete variables are supported by the method only in the case that the distribution factors over all discrete variables conditionally on any additional “continuous variables” (to which the reparameterization trick is applicable).,,arg_evaluative,0
This very much limits the utility of the method.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular it is not applicable to learning e.g. sigmoid belief networks [Neal, 92] (with conditional Bernoulli units) and many other problems.",,arg_evaluative,0
“reparametrizable distributions”,,arg_other,0
"A Bernoulli(p) random variable is discrete, yet it is reparametrizable as [Z>p] with Z following standard logistic distribution, whose density and cdf is smooth.",,arg_evaluative,0
Because of the above many discussions about discrete vs. continuous variables are missleading.,,arg_evaluative,0
Section 2.,,arg_other,0
The notation of the true distribution as “q” the model as p and the approximate posterior of the model as “q” again is inconsistent.,,arg_evaluative,0
I find the background on ELBO and GANs unnecessary occluding the clarity at this point.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For the purpose of introduction, it might be better to give examples of expectation objectives such as:",,arg_request,1
"- dropout: q is the distribution of NN outputs given the input image and integrating out latent dropout noises, gamma are parameters of this NN.",,arg_request,1
"- VAE, GAN: q is the generative model defined as a mapping of a standard multivariate normal distribution by a NN.",,arg_request,1
- sigmoid belief networks: q is a Bayesian network where each conditional distribution is a logistic regression model.,,arg_request,1
"Then to state to which of these cases the results of the paper are applicable, allow for an improvement of the variance and at what additional computational cost (considering the cost of evaluating the discrete derivatives).",,arg_request,1
Section 3.,,arg_other,0
"Contrary to the discussion, there are examples of non-negative distributions to which the reparameterization trick can be applied, including log-Normal and Gamma distributions.",,arg_evaluative,0
Method:,,arg_other,0
"In the case when Rep trick is applicable, is it identical to GO?",,arg_evaluative,0
The difference seems to be only in that the mapping tau may be different from Q^-1.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, this only affects the method of drawing the samples from a fixed known distribution and should have no more effect on the results than say a choice of a pseudo-random number generator.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Yet, in Fig.1 some difference is observed between the methods, why is that so?",,arg_evaluative,0

"This paper researches the pooling operation, which is an important component in convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Taking the perspective from signal processing, this paper proposes a pooling operation called frequency pooling (F-pooling).",,arg_evaluative,0
The key motivation is to make the pooling operation shift-equivalent and anti-aliasing.,,arg_evaluative,0
This paper gives an improved definition on shift-equivalent functions and shows that the proposed F-pooling is optimal in the sense of reconstructing the orignal signal.,,arg_evaluative,0
The F-pooling is then implemented with matrix multiplications and tested with recent convolutional neural networks for image classifiation on CIFAR-100 and a subset of ImageNet dataset.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is interesting to take the perspective from signal processing to give pooling operation in CNN a formal treatment.,,arg_evaluative,0
"As indicated in the recent literature, enforcing shift-invariance does help to improve the performance of a CNN on classification accuracy and the robustness with respect to image shift.",,arg_evaluative,0
"At the same time, this work can be further enhanced at the following aspects:",,arg_structuring,0
1. This work can make it clearer in principle how anti-aliasing contributes to improving the classification performance and robustness.,,arg_request,1
This will help to make this paper more self-contained.,,arg_other,0
"2. When showing the optimality of F-pooling in Section 2.3, the criterion is to reconstruct the original signal x.",,arg_request,1
"Considering that the ultimate goal is classification, the information to be maximally preserved through each operation through the layers shall be the information that relates to the class label y. In light of this, some justification and explanation shall be provided for using this criterion for optimality.",,none,0
3. The experimental study is weak.,,arg_evaluative,0
Experiments could be conducted on more benchmark datasets with more CNN architectures to convincingly show the effectiveness of the proposed F-pooling.,,arg_request,1
"Also, from the three Tables in the experimental part, the improvement of F-pooling over AA-pooling (developed by the main reference of this work) does not seem to be significant or consistent.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, in Table 2, the F-pooling only wins at either accuracy (marginally) or consistency, but not both.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In Table 3, the F-pooling consistently shows inferior classification performance, although obtaining slightly higher consistency.",,arg_fact,0
This makes the advantage of F-pooling over the existing AA-pooling unclear.,,arg_evaluative,0

The MDP formalization is rather straightforward.,,arg_fact,0
"Also, MCTS has been used extensively to find Nash equilibria in both perfect and imperfect games, e.g., ""Online monte carlo counterfactual regret minimization for search in imperfect information games"".",,arg_fact,0

This paper seeks to understand the AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) algorithm and extend the algorithm to regular sequential decision-making problems.,,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, the paper answers three questions regarding AGZ: (i) What is the optimal policy that AGZ is trying to learn?",,arg_structuring,0
(ii) Why is cross-entropy the right objective?,,arg_structuring,0
(iii) How does AGZ extend to generic sequential decision-making problems?,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper shows that AGZ’s optimal policy is a Nash equilibrium, the KL divergence bounds distance to optimal reward, and the two-player zero-sum game could be applied to sequential decision making by introducing the concept of robust MDP.",,arg_structuring,0
Overall the paper is well written.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, there are several concerns about this paper.",,arg_structuring,0
"In fact, the key results obtained in this paper is that minimizing the KL-divergence between the parametric policy and the optimal policy (Nash equilibrium) (using SGD) will converge to the optimal policy.",,arg_structuring,0
"It is based on a bound (2), which states that when the KL-divergence between a policy and the optimal policy goes to zero then the return for the policy will approach that of the optimal policy.",,arg_structuring,0
"This bound is not so surprising because as long as certain regularity condition holds, the policies being close should lead to the returns being close.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, it is an overclaim that the KL-divergence bound (2) provides an immediate justification for AGZ’s core learning algorithm.",,arg_evaluative,0
"As mentioned earlier, the actual conclusion in Section 4.2 is that minimizing the KL-divergence between the parametric policy and the optimal policy by SGD will converge to the optimal policy, which is straightforward and is not what AlphaGo Zero does.",,arg_evaluative,0
This is because there is an important gap: the MCTS policy is not the same as the optimal policy.,,arg_fact,0
The effect of the imperfection in the target policy is not taken into account in the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"A more interesting question to study is how this gap affect the iterative algorithm, and whether/how the error in the imperfect target policy accumulates/diminishes so that iteratively minimizing KL-divergence with imperfect \pi* (by MCTS) could still lead to optimal policy (Nash equilibrium).",,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, the robust MDP view of the AGZ in sequential decision-making problems is not so impressive either.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It is more or less like a reformulation of the AGZ setting in the MDP problem. And it is commonly known that two-player zero-sum game is closely related to minimax robust control. Therefore, it cannot be called as “generalizing AlphaGo Zero” as stated in the title of the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper proposes a method for unsupervised learning  of data representations that can be manipulated to remove factors of variation via linear transformations.,,arg_structuring,0
These transformations are called canonicalizations in the paper.,,arg_structuring,0
"The canonicalizations are trained such that images for arbitrary values of the corresponding factor of variation are transformed into images with a fixed, canonical, value for that factor.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper proposes a model architecture based on a denoising autoencoder, where the canonicalizations are applied to the encoded representation.",,arg_structuring,0
It also proposes a loss function and sampling scheme for training the model.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper demonstrates the method on the dSprites dataset, showing that it can effectively learn linear canonicalizations, and that multiple of these canonicalizations can be applied to the same image representation.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper goes on to test the method on a digit classification task, where the model is trained to learn a representation in a simulator for SVHN data where the transformations to be canonicalized can be controlled, and  used to train a classifier on unseen real data from the SVHN test set.",,arg_structuring,0
"I think this paper should be accepted as it proposes a novel idea, which does not seem too difficult to reproduce, describes a simulator for synthetic data for digit recognition, and proposes it as a benchmark for learning representations, and provides experimental results that help in better understanding the representation learned by the model.",,arg_evaluative,0
A couple things I thought were missing in the paper:,,arg_structuring,0
Did you try applying the classification loss to both the encoded representation and the canonicalized representation at the same time?,,arg_request,1
"For Figure 2, Did you try applying canonicalizations in different orders? Do they give the same results?",,arg_request,1
"Instead of trying to learn idempotency by gradient descent, you could try to parametrize the canonicalizations with a matrix X, such that C =  X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T. C will be idempotent (although restricted to be symmetric).",,arg_fact,0
There might be other constructions that are more efficient and less restrictive.,,arg_evaluative,0

###Summary###,,arg_structuring,0
This paper tackles the multi-source domain adaptation by aggregate multiple source domains dynamically during the training phase.,,arg_structuring,0
"The observation is that in many real-world applications, we want to exploit multiple source datasets of similar tasks to learn a model for a different but related target datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
"Firstly, the paper derives a multiple-source domain adaptation upper-bound from single-to-single domain adaptation generalization bound, based on the theoretical work from Cortes et al (2019).",,arg_structuring,0
"The idea is similar to Zhao et al (2019), which introduces a weighted parameter \alpha to combine the source domains together.",,arg_structuring,0
"Secondly, based on the theoretical result, the paper proposes an algorithm to minimize the upper bound of the theoretical result.",,arg_structuring,0
The upper bound can be simplified as the quartic form (Eq. 4) and can be optimized with the Lagrangian form.,,arg_structuring,0
"Since no closed-form expression for the optimal v can be derived, the authors propose to use binary search to find it.",,arg_structuring,0
"Based on the theoretical results and the algorithm, the paper introduces Domain AggRegation Network (DARN), which contains a base network for feature extraction, h_y to minimize the task loss and h_d to evaluate the discrepancy between each source domain and target domain.",,arg_structuring,0
The loss is aggregation with the parameter \alpha.,,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, the paper conduct experiments on sentimental analysis benchmark, Amazon Review and digit datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper selects MDAN, DANN, MDMN as the baselines.",,arg_structuring,0
"On the amazon review dataset, the performance of the proposed DARN model is comparable with the MDMN baseline.",,arg_structuring,0
"On the digit dataset, the model can outperform the baselines.",,arg_structuring,0

"But it's not guaranteed as the upper bound contains other variables, such as the number of training samples and model complexity.",,arg_evaluative,0
"If the training samples and model complexity (think about the parameters in the deep models) are significantly large, the upper bound of the loss might be also very large.",,arg_evaluative,0

"Currently I lean towards accepting this paper for publication, despite a few issues.",,arg_social,0
It asks an interesting question: can we learn a model of the training dynamics to avoid actually having to do the training?,,arg_request,1
This could potentially prevent a lot of unnecessary computation and also lead to better-performing models.,,arg_fact,0
It then shows some experimental evidence suggesting that this is possible.,,arg_evaluative,0

"1. In the PTB experiment, it looks like the human only adapts the learning rate and leaves the rest of the hyperparameters alone.",,arg_fact,0
Why was this policy used as the baseline? It seems extremely basic and unlikely to truly lead to optimal performance.,,arg_request,1
"2. Why were more baselines from the related work not included? I understand the experiments are a proof of concept, but it would be nice to get a feeling for what some of the other methods do.",,arg_request,1
3. How do PPO and SimPLe handle partial observability? Is it principled to apply them to partially-observable environments?,,arg_request,1
4. Why not use continuous actions with a parameterized policy (e.g. Gaussian)?,,arg_request,1
5. Is it reasonable to assume that the learning dynamics of all deep learning architectures are similar enough that a model trained on one set of deep learning architectures and problems will generalize to new architectures and problems?,,arg_request,1

this makes a lot of sense especially given that CPC / wav2vec recovers phonemes and quantizing the phonemes will recover a language-like version of the raw audio. And running BERT across those tokens will allow you to capture the dependencies at the phoneme level.,,arg_structuring,0
"After pre-training, the authors use the learned representations for speech recognition.",,arg_structuring,0
They compare this to using log-mel filterbanks.,,arg_structuring,0
The results (WER / LER) is lower for the proposed pipeline compared to using dense wav2vec representation for n-gram and character LM.,,arg_structuring,0
It also makes sense that BERT helps for the k-means (vq) setting since the number of codes is large.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors also cleverly adopt/adapt span-BERT which is more suited to this setting.,,arg_structuring,0
"I think this paper presents a useful contribution as far as improving speech / phoneme recognition using self-supervised learning goes, and also has useful engineering aspects in terms of combining CPC and BERT. I would like to see this paper accepted.",,arg_evaluative,0
Overview:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper considers unsupervised (or self-supervised) discrete representation learning of speech using a combination of a recent vector quantized neural network discritization method and future time step prediction.,,arg_structuring,0
Discrete representations are fine-tuned by using these as input to a BERT model; the resulting representations are then used instead of conventional speech features as the input to speech recognition models.,,arg_structuring,0
New state-of-the-art results are achieved on two datasets.,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
The core strength of this paper is in the results that are achieved on standard speech recognition benchmarks.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The results indicate that, while discritization in itself does not give improvements, coupling this with the BERT-objective results in speech features which are better in downstream speech recognition than standard features. I think the main technical novelty is in combining discritization with future time step prediction (but see the weakness below).",,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
The main weakness of the paper is that it does not situate itself within existing literature in this area.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Over the last few years, researchers in the speech community have invested significant effort in learning better speech representations, and this is not discussed.",,arg_evaluative,0
See e.g. [1].,,arg_structuring,0
"Even more importantly, very recently there has been a number of papers investigating discrete representations of speech; see the review [2].",,arg_fact,0
Some of these papers specifically use VQ-VAEs [3].,,arg_fact,0
[4] actually compares VQ-VAE and the Gumbel-Softmax approach.,,arg_fact,0
These studies should be mentioned.,,arg_request,1
This paper is different in that it incorporates future time step prediction.,,arg_structuring,0
"But context prediction has also been considered before, also for speech [5, 6, 7].",,arg_fact,0
This paper can be situated as a new contribution combining these two strands of research.,,arg_fact,0
In the longer run it would be extremely beneficial to the community if this approach is applied to the standard benchmarks as set out in [2].,,arg_fact,0
"As a minor weakness, some parts of the paper is not described in enough detail and the motivation is weak or not exactly clear (see detailed comments below).",,arg_evaluative,0
Overall assessment:,,arg_structuring,0
"I think the results as well as the new combination of existing approaches in the paper warrants publication. But it should be amended significantly to situate itself within the existing literature. I therefore award a ""weak accept"".",,arg_request,1
Detailed questions and suggestions:,,arg_structuring,0
"- Section 1: As motivation for this work, it is stated that ""we aim to make well performing NLP algorithms more widely applicable"".",,arg_structuring,0
"As noted above, some NLP-like ideas (such as prediction of future speech segments, stemming from text-based language modelling) have already been considered within the speech community.",,arg_fact,0
"Rather than motivating the work in this way, it might be helpful to focus the contribution as a combination of future time step prediction and discretization (both of which have been considered in previous work, but not in combination).",,arg_request,1
"- Section 4: Would it be possible to train the vq-wav2vec model jointly with BERT, i.e. as one model? I suspect it would be difficult since, for the masking objective, the discrete units are already required, but maybe there is a scheme where this could work.",,arg_request,1
"- Section 2.2: Similarly to the above question, would there be a way to incorporate the BERT principles directly into an end-to-end model, e.g. by randomly masking some of the continuous input speech?",,arg_request,1
"- Section 3.3: What exactly does ""mode collapse"" refer to in this context? Would this be using only one codebook entry, for instance?",,arg_request,1
"- Section 6: It seems that in all cases to obtain improvements from discritization, BERT is required on top of the vq-wav2vec discrete symbols.",,arg_structuring,0
Is it possible that the output acoustic model is simply better-matched to continuous rather than discrete input (direct vq-wav2vec gives discrete while BERT gives continuous)? Would it make sense to train the wav2vec acoustic model on top of the vqvae codebook entries (e) instead of directly on the symbols?,,arg_request,1

The paper proposes to learn task-level modules progressively to perform the task of VQA.,,arg_structuring,0
"Such task-level modules include object/attribute prediction, image captioning, relationship detection, object counting, and finally VQA model.",,arg_structuring,0
The benefit of using modules for reasoning allows one to visualize the reasoning process more easily to understand the model better.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The results are mainly shown on VQA 2.0 set, with a good amount of analysis.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- I think overall this is a good paper, with clear organization, detailed description of the approach, solid analysis of the approach and cool visualization.",,arg_evaluative,0
I especially appreciate that analysis is done taking into consideration of extra computation cost of the large model; the extra data used for visual relationship detection.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I do not have major comments about the paper itself, although I did not check the technical details super carefully.",,arg_fact,0

This paper presents a new synthetic dataset to evaluate the mathematical reasoning ability of sequence-to-sequence models.,,arg_structuring,0
"It consists of math problems in various categories such as algebra, arithmetic, calculus, etc.",,arg_structuring,0

"Several models including LSTM, LSTM + Attention, Transformer are evaluated on the proposed dataset.",,arg_structuring,0
The result showed some interesting insights about the evaluated models.,,arg_structuring,0
The evaluation of mathematical reasoning ability is an interesting perspective.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, the un-standard design of the LSTM models makes it unclear whether the comparisons are solid enough.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper is relatively well-written, although the description of the neural models can be improved.",,arg_evaluative,0
The generation process of the dataset is well thought out.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The insights from the analysis of the failure cases are intriguing, but it also points out that the neural networks models are not really performing mathematical reasoning since the generalization is very limited.",,arg_fact,0
"One suggestion is that it might be useful to also release the structured (parsed) form besides the freeform inputs and outputs, for analysis and for evaluating structured neural network models like the graph networks.",,arg_request,1

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
The authors present a video prediction model called SAVP that combines a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce more realistic and diverse future samples.,,arg_structuring,0
Deterministic models and certain loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) will produce,,arg_structuring,0
blurry results when making uncertain predictions.,,none,0
"GAN predictions on the other hand usually are more visually appealing but often lack diversity, producing just a few modes.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors propose to combine a VAE model with a GAN objective to combine their strengths: good quality samples (GAN) that cover multiple possible futures (VAE).,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
"[+] GANs are notoriously unstable to train, especially for video.",,arg_fact,0
The authors formulate a VAE-GAN model and successfully implement it.,,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
"[-] The combination of VAEs and GANs, while new for videos, had already been proposed for image generation as indicated in the Related Work section and its formulation for video prediction is relatively straightforward given existing VAE (Denton & Fergus 2018) and GAN models (Tulyakov et al. 2018).",,arg_evaluative,0
"[-] The results indicate that SAVP offers a trade-off between the properties of GANs and VAEs, but does not go beyond its individual parts.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, the experiment of Figure 5 does not show SAVP being significantly more diverse than GANs for KTH (as compared to VAEs).",,none,0
"Furthermore, Figure 6 and Figure 7 in general show SAVP performing worse than SVG (Denton & Fergus 2018), a VAE model with a significantly less complex generator, including for the metric (VGG cosine similarity) that the authors introduce arguing that PSNR and SSIM do not necessarily indicate prediction quality.",,arg_evaluative,0
"While the use of a GAN in general will make the results less blurry and visually appealing, it does not necessarily mean that the samples it generates are going to be plausible or better.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Since a direct application of video prediction is model-based planning, it seems that plausibility might be as important as sample quality.",,none,0
This work proposes to combine VAEs and GANs in a single model to get the benefits of both models.,,arg_fact,0
"However, the experiments conducted generally show that SAVP offers only a trade-off between the visual quality of GANs and the coverage of VAEs, and does not show a clear advantage over current VAE models (Denton & Fergus, 2018) that with simpler architectures obtain similar results.",,arg_evaluative,0
"While the presentation is clear and the evaluation of the model is thorough, I am unsure of the significance of the proposed method.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In order to better assess this model and compare it to its individual parts and other VAE models, could the authors:",,arg_structuring,0

"The paper attempts to clarify the debate on large-batch neural network training, particularly on the relationship between learning rate, batch sizes and test performance.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors claim two contributions towards understanding how the hyper-parameters of SGD affect final training and test performance: (1) SGD exhibits two regimes with different behaviours and (2) large-batch training leads to degradation of test performance even with same step budgets.,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, the authors did a comprehensive study on large-batch training with the support of extensive experiments.",,arg_structuring,0
But I'm concerned with the novelty and contributions of this paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
I tend to reject this paper because (1) the first contribution of the paper is not new as it has already been recognized by a few paper that SGD exhibits two different regimes; (2) this paper makes the debate of large-batch training even muddier.,,arg_evaluative,0
Main argument:,,arg_structuring,0
The paper does not do a great job in clarify the debate.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Particularly, the authors mixed their observations up with the results of published works, making it hard to identify the contributions of this paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, the two regimes mentioned in the paper has been identified by a few other works and the contribution of this paper is just to verify them again.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, I find the experiments done in section 3 and 4 are similar to previous works and even the conclusions are similar.",,arg_evaluative,0
The only new observation I'm aware of in these two sections is that the training loss and test accuracy are independent of batch size in the noise dominated regime.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Back to introduction section, the goal of this paper (as claimed in the beginning of second paragraph) is to clarify the debate.",,arg_fact,0
But does this paper really achieves this goal?,,arg_evaluative,0
"In terms of learning rate scaling, this paper gets similar conclusions as Shallue et al. (2018).",,arg_evaluative,0
"In terms of the difference between vanilla SGD and SGD with momentum, Zhang et al. (2019) already argued that the difference depends on specific batch sizes and SGD with momentum only outperforms SGD in the curvature dominated regime.",,arg_evaluative,0
I think the authors should instead focus on the discussion of generalization performance and the observation that training loss and test accuracy are independent of batch size in noise dominated regime.,,arg_social,0
"To my knowledge, this part is novel and interesting.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In summary, I'm inclined to reject this paper given the current version.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I think the paper is still worth reading if the authors can reorganize the paper and I might increase my score if my concerns get resolved.",,arg_social,0
==============Final Evaluation================,,arg_structuring,0
I have gone through the other reviews as well as the author response.,,arg_social,0
"Firstly, I would like to thank the authors for providing detailed responses to my questions.",,arg_social,0
"In general, I agree with R2 that the paper generally has some potentially interesting ideas and results but the manner in which the current draft is organized and presented makes it hard to grasp them and there is a lack of coherent message about what the paper is about.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Moreover, from my understanding the analysis in David McKay’s book (Chapter 41) concerns a single neuron (and the number of parameters for a single neuron)",,arg_fact,0
.,,none,0
"As pointed out by R2, with depth there are a lot more number of possible ways in which one could carve out decision boundaries to separate data points, thus, it is not clear that the loose linear upper bound holds Specifically, as one might expect with depth it could be possible that linear capacity increase is a lower bound (I am not suggesting that it is, but that possibility should be considered and explained in the paper).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Similarly, it would be good to formally connect the capacity to the rate of memorization before making a statement about them being related (as suggested in the initial review).",,arg_evaluative,0
"In general, I feel this section could use some tighter formalism and justifications.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I also remain unconvinced by the response to my issue with the claim “Our experiments show that our networks can remember a large number of images and distinguish them from unseen images”, where the negative images are also seen by the memorization model, so they are not unseen.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors address this by saying 3M of the 15 M negatives have been seen.,,arg_fact,0
That does not seem like a small enough percentage to claim that these are “unseen” images.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In general, I feel the paper is interesting but would benefit from a major revision which makes the message of the paper more clear, and addresses these and other issues raised in the review phase. Thus I am holding my current rating.",,arg_evaluative,0
==================,,arg_structuring,0
Summary,,arg_structuring,0
The paper trains classification models to classify a labeling of a subset of images (assigned with label 1) from the rest of the images (assigned with a label 0).,,arg_structuring,0
"Firstly, the paper shows that deep learning models are able to learn such classifiers and get low training loss.",,arg_structuring,0
"It then proposes to use this model to ``attack’’ task-specific models to perform membership inference, i.e. figuring out if an image provided in a set was used in training or not.",,arg_structuring,0
Strengths,,arg_structuring,0
+ The paper thoroughly covers related work and provides context.,,arg_evaluative,0
+ Results on confidence as a signature of a dataset are interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses,,arg_structuring,0
[Motivation],,arg_structuring,0
1.,,none,0
"In general, recent work has found that the raw number of parameters has little to do with the size of the model class or the capacity of a model for deep models, and thus work like [A] has been trying to come up with better complexity measures for models to explain generalization.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Thus, without sufficient justification the assertion in the paper that the capacity of the network is well approximated by the number of parameters does not seem correct.",,none,0
"Also, the claim in Fig. 1 that the transition from ‘’high capacity’’ to low capacity happens at the number of parameters in the network seems a bit loose and hard to substantiate from what I understand, and should be toned down. (*)",,arg_evaluative,0
[Capacity],,arg_structuring,0
"2. Sec. 3.3, Fig. 3: The capacity (in terms of parameters)of both Resnet-18 and VGG-16 is higher than the capcity for YFCC100M dataset for n=10K images (comes to 161K bits), while the capacity of Resnet-18, with 14.7 million parameters (assuming float32 encoding) has 14.7 * 32 bits = 470.4 million bits, thus capacity alone cannot explain why VGG converges faster than Resnet-18, since both networks exceed the capacity, and capacity does not seem to have an established formal connection to rate of memorization.",,arg_evaluative,0
This is something which would need to be explained/ substantiated separately.,,none,0
(*),,none,0
3. Scenario discussed in Sec. 4 seems somewhat impractical.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Given a set of m images, it is not clear that a classifier that is trained to detect between train and validation is sufficient, as one might also need to figure out if it is neither train nor val, which is a very practical scenario.",,none,0
4. Fig. 3 (right): It is not clear,,arg_evaluative,0
"why the fact that the classifier is able to predict which dataset the image ‘m’ corresponds to is useful or practical, as this seems to be a property of the set ‘m’ rather than the property of the trained classification model (f_\theta)",,none,0

Please clarify.,,arg_request,1
"On the other hand it is clear that using the confidence of the model to predict the dataset is a useful property, but the right side of the Fig. is very confusing.",,arg_evaluative,0
(*),,none,0
6.,,none,0
"It is not clear to me what the point of Sec. 5 is, given a trained model, one wants to figure out if an image was present in the training of the model.",,arg_evaluative,0
"While the baseline approaches seem to make use of the model confidence, I cannot see how the proposed approach (which uses a classifier) makes use of the original model.",,none,0
It is also not clear why Table. 3 does not report the Bayes baseline results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, does this section use the classifier for predicting the dataset, or is the approach reported in the section, the MAT approach?",,none,0
"7. ``Our experiments show that our networks can remember a large number of images and distinguish them from unseen images’’ -- this does not seem to be true, since the model is trained on both n as well as N -n ``unseen’’ images which it labels as the negative class, thus the negative class is also seen by the memorization model.",,arg_evaluative,0
(*),,none,0
Minor Points,,arg_structuring,0
1. It is not clear that training a network to classify a set from another set is necessarily equivalent to ``memorization’’.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In addition, the paper would also need to show that such a model does not generalize to a validation set of images.",,arg_evaluative,0
This is probably obvious given the results from Zhang et.al. but should be included as a sanity check.,,none,0
"2. Figure 3: it is confusing to call the cumulative distribution of the maximum classification score as the CDF of the model (y-axis fig. 3 left) as CDF means something else generally in such contexts, as the CDF of a predictor.",,arg_evaluative,0

This paper introduces Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO) that optimizes a proximal objective at each optimization step.,,arg_structuring,0
The optimization hyperparameters are optimized to best minimize the proximal objective.,,arg_structuring,0
"The objective is represented using a regularization style parameter lambda and a distance metric D that, depending on its definition, reduces the optimization procedure to Gauss-Newton, General Gauss Newton or Natural Gradient Descent.",,arg_structuring,0

The proposed method is based on the theoretical extension of the single-source domain discrepancy measure proposed by Mansour et al. 2009 to the multi-source setting.,,arg_structuring,0
This paper also showed the effectiveness of the proposed method on some real-world datasets.,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper introduces new technical insights to understand their bound, e.g. effective sample size.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper proposed the way to estimate coefficient, optimal \alpha, with theoretical justification, and I think this is the biggest contribution of this paper and is interesting.",,arg_evaluative,0
The proposed method is also able to be used in the regression task since it is based on the disc which can be estimated in the regression task.,,arg_evaluative,0
Weakness,,arg_structuring,0
"The main theorem of this paper is an extension of existing methods, so the novelty of theoretical analysis is somewhat limited.",,arg_evaluative,0
"A naive approach to estimate coefficient with single-source domain discrepancy measures such as [1]Mansour (2009), [2,3] Ben-David(2007, 2010), [4] Kuroki et al (2019), and W1-distance is not considered.",,arg_evaluative,0
Experimental results itself are fine but not complete.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- Although disc can be easily estimated in the regression task (differently from d_A distance which is a special case of disc), there are no experimental results of the regression task even in the synthetic data.",,arg_evaluative,0
- It would be also better to show the coefficient of existing methods that have no theoretical justification.,,arg_request,1
"- It would be better to compare with a naive approach that uses domain discrepancy between each source and target as (fixed) coefficient since this approach such as Mansour (2009), Ben-David(2007, 2010) and Kuroki et al (2019) which explicitly consider the hypothesis class has theoretical justification in the form of generalization error bound in the target domain.",,arg_request,1
"Overall, I like the approach of the proposed method, especially tuning coefficient during training procedure although novelty in the theoretical analysis is somewhat limited.",,arg_evaluative,0
So this work has to be supported with more detailed experimental results to express the potential of this approach fully.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For this reason, I think it is okay but not good enough at this time.",,arg_evaluative,0

The authors' response addressed my remaining questions.,,arg_other,0
"This paper explores self-supervised learning in the low-data regime, comparing results to self-supervised learning on larger datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
"BiGAN, RotNet, and DeepCluster serve as the reference self-supervised methods.",,arg_structuring,0
"It argues that early layers of a convolutional neural network can be effectively learned from a single source image, with data augmentation.",,arg_structuring,0
"A performance gap exists for deeper layers, suggesting that larger datasets are required for self-supervised learning of useful filters in deeper network layers.",,arg_structuring,0
I believe the primary claim of this paper is neither surprising nor novel.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The long history of successful hand-designed descriptors in computer vision, such as SIFT [Lowe, 1999] and HOG [Dalal and Triggs, 2005], suggest that one can design (with no data at all) features reminiscent of those learned in the first couple layers of a convolutional neural network (local image gradients, followed by characterization of those gradients over larger local windows).",,arg_fact,0
"More importantly, it is already well established that it is possible to learn, from only a few images, filter sets that resemble the early layers of filters learned by CNNs.",,arg_fact,0
This paper fails to account for a vast amount of literature on modeling natural images that predates the post-AlexNet deep-learning era.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, see the following paper (over 5600 citations according to Google scholar):",,arg_structuring,0

Compare to the conv1 filters in Figure 2 of the paper under review.,,arg_fact,0
This 1996 paper clearly established that it is possible to learn such filters from a small number of images.,,arg_fact,0
"There is long history of sparse coding and dictionary learning techniques, including multilayer representations, that follows from the early work of [1].",,arg_fact,0
"The paper should at minimum engage with this extensive history, and, in light of it, explain whether its claims are actually novel.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors consider the few-shot / meta-learning scenario in which the test set of interest is drawn from a different distribution from the training set.,,arg_structuring,0
This scenario,,arg_structuring,0
"is well-motivated by the ""researcher example"" given throughout the paper.",,none,0
"The authors assume access to a large unlabelled set in test (target) domain, and a large labelled (few-shot) set in the source domain.",,arg_structuring,0
"Thus, the paper is concerned with unsupervised version of the meta-learning problem under domain shift (i.e., a large amount of data unlabelled are available from the target domain).",,arg_structuring,0
The key idea is to learn a mapping from the source domain to the target domain.,,arg_structuring,0
"This mapping is learned jointly with the meta-learner, who performs the meta-learning in the target domain, on examples from the labelled domain.",,arg_structuring,0
"In practice however, it appears from the experimental section that the domain mapping is learned offline, and then frozen for the meta-learning phase.",,arg_structuring,0
"Thus, at test time, given examples from the target domain, the meta-learner can perform few-shot learning.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
"- The paper addresses an important scenario which has not been addressed to this point: namely, meta-learning without the assumption that the train and test sets are drawn from the same domain/distribution.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- The authors propose a novel task and experimental framework for considering their method, and show (somewhat unsurprisingly) that their method outperforms standard meta-learning methods that do not properly account for domain shift.",,arg_evaluative,0
- The paper reads well and is easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
"- My main concern is reproducibility: the authors employ a number of large architectures, complex loss functions, and regularizers / ""additional improvements"".",,arg_evaluative,0
"Further, there a number of experimental details that need to be further elaborated upon.",,arg_request,1
"e.g., architectures and hyper-parameters used, and training procedures (I encourage the authors to utilize the appendices for this).",,arg_request,1
It is unclear to me how difficult/easy these results would be to reproduce. Do the authors intend to release code for their implementations and experiments?,,arg_request,1
- Some assumptions are not explicitly stated.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, it is unclear what the assumption on the size of the unlabelled test set is.",,arg_request,1
"This is also lacking from the description of the experimental protocol, which does not address the data-splits (how many classes were used for each) and size of the unlabelled test set.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- While the method is presented as jointly learning all the components, in the experimental section it is stated that the embedding network (the meta-learner) and the GAN-based domain adaptation are done separately. Can the authors comment on this further?",,arg_request,1
"Is this different from first learning a image translation mapping (using the unlabelled data in the target domain), and then applying existing meta-learning models/algorithms to the labelled data in the target domain?",,arg_request,1
"- The overall method seems to be not very principled, and requires a lot of ""tweaks and tunes"", with additional losses and regularizers, to work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall, the paper proposes a method combining a number of existing useful works (prototypical networks for meta-learning and image-to-image translation for domain adaptation) to tackle an important problem setting that is not currently addressed in existing meta-learning research.",,arg_structuring,0
"Further, it establishes a useful experimental benchmark for this task, and provides what appear to be reasonable results (though this is somewhat difficult to judge due to the lack of baseline approaches).",,arg_structuring,0
"Hopefully, such a benchmark will inspire more researchers to explore this setting, and perhaps propose simpler, more principled approaches to perform this task.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It is my impression that, if the authors elaborate on the experimental protocol and implementation details, this paper would be a good fit for the venue.",,arg_request,1
The paper addresses the problem of producing sensible (high) uncertainties on out of distribution (OOD) data along with accurate predictions on in-distribution data.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors consider a model wherein the weights of the network (\theta) are drawn from a matrix normal distribution whose parameters are in-turn a (non-linear; parameterized by a another network) function of the covariates (x).,,arg_structuring,0
"Instead of inferring a posterior over theta that then induces the predictive uncertainties, uncertainties here arise from a regularizer that penalizes the distribution over theta from deviating too far from a standard Normal.",,arg_structuring,0
"Experiments present results on toy data, MNIST/not MNIST as well as on adversarial perturbations of MNIST and CIFAR 10 datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper is clearly written and addresses an important problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper presents both an alternate model as well as an alternate objective function.,,arg_structuring,0
"While the authors do report some interesting results, they do a poor job of motivating the proposed extensions.",,arg_evaluative,0
It isn’t clear why the particular proposals are necessary or to which of the proposed extensions the inflated OOD uncertainties can be attributed:,,arg_evaluative,0
1. The proposed model? Is using a conditional weight prior p(\theta | x) (Eq 3) instead of p(\theta) (as in BNNs)  necessary for the inflated uncertainties on OOD data?,,arg_request,1
"2. The  objective? The proposed objective,  Eq 5, trades off stochastically approximating the (conditional) marginal likelihood against not deviating too much from p(\theta) =  MN(0, I, I) in the KL sense.",,arg_request,1
"Depending on \lambda, the objective either closely approximates the marginal likelihood or not.",,arg_fact,0
It is unclear how important this particular objective is to the results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"-  Instead of relying on the KL regularizer, a standard approach to learning the model in Eq 3 would be to use well understood MCMC or variational methods that explicitly retain uncertainty in \theta and induce predictive uncertainties.  Were they explored and found to be not effective?",,arg_request,1
It would be nice to see how a “gold standard” HMC based inference does on at least the small toy problem of Sec 5.1?,,arg_request,1
"- There is also a closely related variant of Eq 3 which we can arrive at by switching the log and the expectation in the first term of Eq 5 and applying Jensen’s inequality —> E_p(\theta| x)[ln p(y | x, \theta)] - KL (p(\theta | x) || p(\theta)).",,arg_fact,0
"This would correspond to maximizing a valid lower bound to the marginal likelihood of a BNN model p(y | x, \theta) p(\theta), while interpreting p(\theta | x) as an amortized variational approximation.",,arg_fact,0
"This variant has the advantage that it provides a valid lower bound on the marginal likelihood, and exploits the well understood variational inference machinery.",,arg_fact,0
"This also immediately suggests, that the variational approximation , p (\theta | x)  should probably depend on both x and y rather than only on x and the flexibility of the hyper networks g would govern how well the true posterior over weights \theta can be approximated.",,arg_fact,0
Comparisons against these more standard inference algorithms is essential for understanding what advantages are afforded by the objective proposed in the paper.,,arg_request,1
"3.  Or simply to a well tuned \lambda, chosen on a per dataset basis? From the text it appears that \lambda is manually selected to trade off accuracy against uncertainty on OOD data.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In the real world, one would not have access to OOD data during training, how is one to pick \lambda in such cases?",,arg_request,1
Detailed comments about experiments:,,arg_structuring,0
a) The uncertainties produced by CDN in Figure 2 seems strange.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Why does it go to nearly zero around x = 0, while being higher in surrounding regions with more data?",,arg_request,1
b) Down weighting the KL term by lambda for the VI techniques unfairly biases the comparison.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This forces the VI solution to tend to the MLE, sacrificing uncertainty in the variational distribution.",,arg_evaluative,0
It would be good to include comparisons against VI with \lambda = 1.,,arg_request,1
==========,,arg_structuring,0
There are potentially interesting ideas in this paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, as presented these ideas are poorly justified and careful comparisons against sensible baselines are missing.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I read the paper and understand it, for the most part.",,arg_social,0
"The idea is to interpret some regularization technics as a from of noisy bottleneck, where the mutual information b tween learned parameters and the data is limited through the injection of noise.",,arg_structuring,0
"While, the paper is a plaisant read, I find difficult to access its importance and the applicability of the ideas presented beyond the analogy with the capacity computation. Perhaps other referee will have a clearer opinion.",,arg_evaluative,0
I'd be interested to hear if the authors see a connection between their formalism and the one of Reference prior in Bayesian inference (Bernardo et al https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0156),,arg_request,1
"Pro: nicely written, clear interpretation of regularization as a noise injection technics, explicit link with information theoery and Shanon capacity.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Con: not clear to me how strong and wide the implications are, beyond the analogies and the reinterpretation",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper points out that the traditional way of model selection is flawed due to that the validation/test set is often small.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors also attribute the existence of adversarial examples to the small validation/test set, which I agree to some degree.",,arg_structuring,0
"Hence, the authors proposed an alternative approach to comparing different classification models by the notion of inter-model discrepancy.",,arg_structuring,0
"The main idea is reasonable, but it requires that the models to compare all perform reasonably well.",,arg_structuring,0
"Otherwise, some poorly performed models could lead to near-random or adversarial inter-model discrepancies, failing the proposed approach.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Another potential issue is that the proposed approach cannot handle training set bias. If all models are biased in similar ways (e.g., toward a particular class or domain), they will not reveal informative discrepancies for the images over which they all make similar mistakes.",,arg_evaluative,0
Another question which is not answered in the paper is the number $k$ of images to select for each pair of classifiers. Is this number task-dependent? Is it related to the number of classes?,,arg_request,1
What is a general guideline for one to choose this number $k$ given a new application scenario?,,arg_request,1
"The unlabeled set is not ""unlabeled"" in essence. If my understanding was correct, it cannot contain open-set images which do not belong to any of the classes of interest.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is also nontrivial to control that the images contain only one salient object per image.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Hence, while I agree with the authors that existing approaches to comparing deep neural network classifiers could be improved, I think the proposed solution is not a good alternative yet.",,arg_evaluative,0
# Summary,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper proposes a new kind of spherical convolution for use in spherical CNNs, and evaluates it on rigid and non-rigid 3D shape recognition and retrieval problems.",,arg_structuring,0
Previous work has either used general anisotropic convolution or azimuthally isotropic convolution.,,arg_structuring,0
"The former produces feature maps on SO(3), which is deemed undesirable because processing 3-dimensional feature maps is costly.",,arg_structuring,0
"The latter produces feature maps on the sphere, but requires that filters be circularly symmetric / azimuthally isotropic, which limits modeling capacity.",,arg_structuring,0
This paper proposes an anisotropic spherical convolution that produces 2D spherical feature maps.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper also introduces an efficient way of processing geodesic / icosahedral spherical grids, avoiding complicated spectral algorithms.",,arg_structuring,0
# Strengths,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper has several strong points.,,arg_evaluative,0
"It is well written, clearly structured, and the mathematics is clear and precise while avoiding unnecessary complexity.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Much of the relevant related work is discussed, and this is done in a balanced way.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Although it is not directly measured, it does seem highly likely that the alt-az convolution is more computationally efficient than SO(3) convolution, and more expressive than isotropic S2 convolution.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The most important contribution in my opinion is the efficient data structure presented in section 4, which allows the spherical convolution to be computed efficiently on GPUs for a grid that is much more homogeneous than the lat/lon grids used in previous works (which have very high resolution near the poles, and low resolution at the equator).",,arg_evaluative,0
"The idea of carving up the icosahedral grid in just the right way, so that the spherical convolution can be computed as a planar convolution with funny boundary conditions, is very clever, elegant, and practical.",,arg_evaluative,0
# Weaknesses,,arg_structuring,0
There is however a misunderstanding about the properties of the alt-az convolution that must be cleared up before this paper can be published.,,arg_evaluative,0
"To start with, the set of rotations R(phi, nu, 0) called the alt-az group in this paper is not a group in the mathematical sense.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This easy to see, because a composition of rotations of the form Rz(phi) Ry(nu) is not generally of that form.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For instance we can multiply Rz(phi) Ry(nu) by the element Rz(omega)Ry(0) = Rz(omega), which gives the element Rz(phi) Ry(nu) Rz(omega).",,arg_fact,0
"As noted in the paper, this is a general element of SO(3) (and hence not in the set of alt-az rotations)",,arg_evaluative,0
.,,arg_other,0
So the closure axiom of a group is violated.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This matters, because the notion of equivariance really only makes sense for a group.",,arg_evaluative,0
"If a layer l satisfies l R = R l  (for R a alt-az rotation), then it automatically satisfies l RR' = RR' l, which means l is equivariant to the whole group generated by the set of alt-az rotations.",,arg_fact,0
"As we saw before, this is the whole rotation group.",,arg_other,0
"This would mean that the layer is actually SO(3)-equivariant, but it has been proven [1], that any rotation equivariant layer between scalar spherical feature maps can be expressed as an azimuthally isotropic convolution.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Since the alt-az convolution is not isotropic and maps between scalars on S2, it cannot be equivariant.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This also becomes apparent in the experiments section, where rotational data augmentation is found to be necessary.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper does not contain an attempted proof of equivariance, and if one tries to give one, the impossibility of doing so will become apparent.",,arg_evaluative,0
I note that the alt-az convolution *is* equivariant to rotations in the subgroup SO(2) of rotations around the Z-axis.,,arg_evaluative,0
Another somewhat jarring fact about the alt-az convolution is that it is not well defined on the south pole.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The south pole can be represented by any pair of coordinates of the form phi in [0, 2pi], nu = +/- pi.",,arg_fact,0
"But it is easy to see that eq. 10 will give different results for each of these coordinates, because they correspond to different rotations of the filter about the Z-axis.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This is ultimately due to the fact that the set of alt-az rotations is not the same as the set of points on the sphere, topologically speaking.",,arg_evaluative,0
The set of points on the sphere can only be viewed as the quotient SO(3)/S(2).,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paragraph motivating the alt-az convolution on page 4 is not very clear, and some claims are questionable.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I agree that local SO(2) invariance is too limiting. But it is not true that rotating filters is not effective in planar/volumetric CNNs, as shown by many recent papers on equivariant networks.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I would suggest rewriting this paragraph to make it clearer and less speculative, and acknowledge that although rotating filters might increase computational complexity, it has often been shown very effective.",,arg_request,1
# Other comments,,arg_structuring,0
The experiments show that the method is quite effective.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For instance, the SHREC17 results are on par with Cohen et al. and Esteves et al., presumably at a significantly reduced computational cost.",,arg_evaluative,0
That they do not substantially outperform these and other methods,,arg_evaluative,0
"is likely due to the input representation, which is lossy, leading to a maximal performance shared by all three methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
"An application to omnidirectional vision might more clearly show the strength of the method, but this would be a lot of work so I do not expect the authors to do that for this paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would be nice to see a more direct comparison between the three definitions of spherical convolution (general SO3, isotropic S2, and anisotropic S2).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Right now, the numbers reported in Cohen et al. and Esteves et al. are copied over, but there are probably many differences between the precise setup and architectures used in these papers.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would be interesting to see what happens if one uses the same architecture on a number of problems, changing only the convolution in each case.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Initially, I was a bit puzzled about why SO(3) augmentation seems to reduce accuracy in table 1.",,arg_evaluative,0
I think this is because SO(3) augmentation actually makes the classification problem harder if the input is initially aligned.,,arg_fact,0
Some more explanation / discussion would be good.,,arg_request,1
It would be nice to explain the spherical parameterization in more detail. Is this operation itself rotation equivariant?,,arg_request,1

# Conclusion,,arg_structuring,0
"Although the alt-az convolution lacks the mathematical elegance of the general anisotropic and azimuthally isotropic spherical convolutions, it still seems like a practically useful operation for some kinds of data, particularly when implemented using the homogeneous icosahedral/hexagonal grid and fast algorithm presented in this paper.",,arg_structuring,0
"Hence, I would wholeheartedly recommend acceptance of this paper if the authors correct the factual errors (e.g. the claim of SO(3)-equivariance) and provide a clear discussion of the issues.",,arg_other,0

The paper proposes using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for fast adversarial attacks.,,arg_fact,0
They prove upper bounds on the Frank-Wolfe gap and show experimentally that they can attack successfully much faster than other algorithms.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In general I find the paper novel (to the best of my somewhat limited knowledge), interesting and well written.",,arg_evaluative,0
However I find the white-box experiments lacking as almost every method has 100% success rate.,,arg_evaluative,0
Fixing this would significantly improve the paper.,,none,0
Main remarks:,,arg_structuring,0
- Need more motivation for faster white-box attack.,,arg_evaluative,0
"One good motivation for example is adversarial training, e.g. Kurakin et al 2017 ‘ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING AT SCALE’ that would benefit greatly from faster attacks",,arg_fact,0
"- White-box attack experiments don’t really prove the strength of the method, even with imagenet experiments, as almost all attacks get 100% success rate making it hard to compare.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Need to compare in more challenging settings where the success rate is meaningful, e.g. smaller epsilon or a more robust NN using some defence.",,arg_request,1
Also stating the 100% success rate in the abstract is a bit misleading for the this reason.,,arg_evaluative,0
"-Something is a bit weird with the FGM results. While it is a weaker attack, a 0%/100% disparity between it and every other",,arg_evaluative,0
attack seems odd.,,none,0
-The average distortion metric (that’s unfavourable to your method anyway) doesn’t really mean anything as the constraint optimization has no incentive to find a value smaller than the constraint.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- Regarding lambda>1, you write that “we argue this modification makes our algorithm more general, and gives rise to better attack results”.",,arg_fact,0
I did not see any theoretical or empirical support for this in the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, it seems quite strange to me that making the FW overshot and then projecting back would be beneficial.",,arg_evaluative,0

This paper explores maximally expressive linear layers for jointly exchangeable data and in doing so presents a surprisingly expressive model.,,arg_structuring,0
I have given it a strong accept because the paper takes a very well-studied area (convolutions on graphs) and manages to find a far more expressive model (in terms of numbers of parameters) than what was previously known by carefully exploring the implications of the equivariance assumptions implied by graph data.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The result is particularly interesting because the same question was asked about exchangeable matrices (instead of *jointly* exchangeable matrices) by Hartford et al. [2018] which lead to a model with 4 bases instead of the 15 bases in this model, so the additional assumption of joint exchangeability (i.e. that any permutations applied to rows of a matrix must also be applied to columns - or equivalently, the indices of the rows and columns of a matrix refer to the same items / nodes) gives far more flexibility but without losing anything with respect to the Hartford et al result (because it can be recovered using a bipartite graph construction - described below).",,arg_evaluative,0
So we have a case where an additional assumption is both useful (in that it allows for the definition of a more flexible model) and benign (because it doesn't prevent the layer from being used on the data explored in Hartford et al.).,,arg_evaluative,0
I only have a couple of concerns:,,arg_structuring,0
1 - I would have liked to see more discussion about why the two results differ to give readers intuition about where the extra flexibility comes from.,,arg_request,1
The additional parameters of this paper come from having parameters associated with the diagonal (intuitively: self edges get treated differently to other edges) and having parameters for the transpose of the matrix (intuitively: incoming edges are different to outgoing edges).,,arg_other,0
Neither of these assumptions apply in the exchangeable setting (where the matrix may not be square so the diagonal and transpose can't be used).,,arg_evaluative,0
"Because these differences aren't explained, the synthetic tasks in the experimental section make this approach look artificially good in comparison to Hartford et al.",,arg_request,1
"The tasks are explicitly designed to exploit these additional parameters - so framing the synthetic experiments as, ""here are some simple functions for which we would need the additional parameters that we define"" makes sense; but arguing that Hartford et al. ""fail approximating rather simple functions"" (page 7) is misleading because the functions are precisely the functions on which you would expect Hartford et al. to fail (because it's designed for a different setting).",,arg_evaluative,0
"2 - Those more familiar of the graph convolution literature will be more familiar with GCN [kipf et al. 2016] / GraphSAGE [Hamilton et al. 2017] / Monti et al [2017] / etc.. Most of these approaches are more restricted version of this work / Hartford et al. so we wouldn't expect them to perform any differently from the Hartford et al.  baseline on the synthetic dataset, but including them will strengthen the author's argument in favour of the work.",,arg_evaluative,0
I would have also liked to see a comparison to these methods in the the classification results.,,arg_request,1
3 - Appendix A - the 6 parameters for the symmetric case with zero diagonal reduces to the same 4 parameters from Hartford et al. if we constrained the diagonal to be zero in the output as well as the input.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This is the case when you map an exchangeable matrix into a jointly exchangeable matrix by representing it as a bipartite graph [0, X; X^T, 0].",,arg_evaluative,0
So the two results coincide for the exchangeable case. Might be worth pointing this out.,,arg_request,1
"The authors seek to make it practical to use the full-matrix version of Adagrad’s adaptive preconditioner (usually one uses the diagonal version), by storing the r most recently-seen gradient vectors in a matrix G, and then showing that (GG^T)^(-½) can be calculated fairly efficiently (at the cost of one r*r matrix inversion, and two matrix multiplications by an r*d matrix).",,arg_structuring,0
This is a really nice trick.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I’m glad to see that the authors considered adding momentum (to adapt ADAM to this setting), and their experiments show a convincing benefit in terms of performance *per iteration*. Interestingly, they also show that the models found by their method also don’t generalize poorly, which is noteworthy and slightly surprising.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, their algorithm--while much less computationally expensive than true full-matrix adaptive preconditioning---is still far more expensive than the usual diagonal version.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In Appendix B.1, they report mixed results in terms of wall-clock time, and I strongly feel that these results should be in the main body of the paper.",,arg_request,1
One would *expect* the proposed approach to work better than diagonal preconditioning on a per-iteration basis (at least in terms of training loss).,,arg_fact,0
"A reader’s most natural question is whether there is a large enough improvement to offset the extra computational cost, so the fact that wall-clock times are relegated to the appendix is a significant weakness.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Finally, the proposed approach seems to sort of straddle the line between traditional convex optimization algorithms, and the fast stochastic algorithms favored in machine learning.",,arg_fact,0
"In particular, I think that the proposed algorithm has a more-than-superficial resemblance to stochastic LBFGS: the main difference is that LBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian, instead of (GG^T)^(-½).",,arg_fact,0
It would be interesting to see how these two algorithms stack up.,,arg_request,1
"Overall, I think that this is an elegant idea and I’m convinced that it’s a good algorithm, at least on a per-iteration basis.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, it trades-off computational cost for progress-per-iteration, so I think that an explicit analysis of this trade-off (beyond what’s in Appendix B.1) must be in the main body of the paper.",,arg_request,1
The paper studies the Bayesian inferences with the generative adversarial network (GAN).,,arg_structuring,0
"In the first half of the paper, the general framework of the Bayes estimation is introduced.",,arg_structuring,0

- How does the estimation accuracy of GAN relate to the estimation accuracy of the proposed method? Showing a quantitative description would be nice.,,arg_request,1
This paper introduces a technique using ensembles of models with MC-dropout to perform uncertainty sampling for active learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"In active learning, there is generally a trade-off between data efficiency and computational cost.",,arg_structuring,0
"This paper proposes a combination of existing techniques, not just ensembling neural networks and not just doing MC dropout, but doing both.",,arg_structuring,0
"The improvements over basic ensembling are rather minimal, at the cost of extra computation.",,arg_structuring,0
"More specifically, the data efficiency (factor improvement in data to achieve some accuracy) of the proposed method over using a deterministic ensemble is around just 10% or so.",,arg_structuring,0
"On the other hand, the proposed algorithm requires 100x more forward passes when computing the uncertainty (which may be significant, unclear without runtime experiments).",,arg_structuring,0
"As a concrete experiment to determine the importance, what would be the accuracy and computational comparison of ensembling 4+ models without MC-dropout vs. 3 ensembled models with MC-dropout?",,arg_request,1

The experimental results show that the proposed methods works well on this particular setup on CIFAR data set.,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0

Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
- novelty is low: the proposed algorithm is a heuristic similar to previously proposed algorithms in the transfer learning and auxiliary learning space,,arg_evaluative,0
- there is no attempt to provide a theoretical insight into the performance of the algorithm,,arg_evaluative,0
"- the problem assumptions are too simplistic and unrealistic (feature distributions of target and auxiliary data are identical), so it is questionable if the proposed algorithm has practical importance",,arg_evaluative,0

"This paper presents a gradient estimator for expectation-based objectives, which is called Go-gradient.",,arg_structuring,0
"This estimator is unbiased, has low variance and, in contrast to other previous approaches, applies to either continuous and discrete random variables.",,arg_structuring,0
"They also extend this estimator to problems where the gradient should be ""backpropagated"" through a nested combination of random variables and a (non-linear) functions.",,arg_structuring,0
Authors present an extensive experimental evaluation of the estimator on different challenging machine learning problems.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper addresses a relevant problem which appears in many machine learning settings, as it is the problem of estimating the gradient of an expectation-based objective.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In general, the paper is well written and easy to follow. And the experimental evaluation is extensive and compares with relevant state-of-the-art methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
The main problem with this paper is that it is difficult to identify its main and novel contributions.,,arg_evaluative,0
"1. In the case of continuous random variables, Go-gradient is equal to Implicit Rep gradients (Figurnov et al. 2018) and pathwise gradients (Jankowiack & Obermeyer,2018).",,arg_fact,0
"Furthermore, for the Gaussian case, Implicit Rep gradients (and Go-gradient too) are equal to the standard reparametrization trick estimator (Kingma & Welling, 2014).",,arg_fact,0
This should be made crystal-clear in the paper.,,arg_request,1
What happens is that the authors arrive at this solution using a different approach.,,arg_fact,0
"In this sense, claims about the low-variance of GO-gradient wrt to other reparametrization baed estimators should be removed, as they are the same.",,arg_request,1
"Moreover, I don't think some of the presented experiments are necessary.",,arg_evaluative,0
Simply because for continuous variables similar experiments have been reported before,,arg_evaluative,0
"(Figurnov et al. 2018, Jankowiack & Obermeyer,2018).",,none,0

The paper proposes a technique to perform reasoning on mathematical formulas in a latent space.,,arg_structuring,0
The model is trained to predict whether a rewrite rule can be applied to a formula given its latent representation.,,arg_structuring,0
"When the rewrite is possible, the model also predicts the embedding of the resulting formula.",,arg_structuring,0
"Experiments show that the network can be applied multiple steps in a row, while operating only in the embedding space.",,arg_structuring,0
"1. As mentioned in the paragraph before Section 4.1, it would be much simpler to consider a single latent embedding space L. In that case, \sigma and \alpha become unnecessary and we only need to train \omega.",,arg_evaluative,0
Did you try to have a single network?,,arg_request,1
"This seems a much more natural approach to me, and I'm surprised that you did not start with that.",,arg_evaluative,0
"From my experience, aligning embedding spaces is something that usually does not work very well, especially in high dimension.",,arg_evaluative,0
The role of \sigma seems very redundant given \omega.,,arg_evaluative,0
"2. If you consider \sigma, why do you also predict the rewrite success with \omega? Couldn't it be simply a function from S x S -> L ?",,arg_request,1
"3. The graph neural networks used in the model are not described in the paper, only a reference to Paliwal et al (2019) is given.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would be helpful to have a brief paragraph describing this architecture, for readers not familiar with the referenced paper.",,arg_request,1
"4. How large is the training set of (T, P) pairs? I don't think this is mentioned in the paper.",,arg_request,1
"5. To train \sigma and \omega, the negative instances are selected randomly.",,arg_fact,0
You mention that negative mining should improve over this strategy. What does negative mining correspond to in this context? Are there bad rewrites better than others?,,arg_request,1
"6. Did you consider using an inverse function (say G), that maps an embedding in L / L' back to S (i.e. the inverse function of gamma / gamma').",,arg_request,1
"I would imagine that even if an embedding X is a bit noisy, because not exactly equal to gamma(P) where P is the expression it represents, you could consider doing the propagation with gamma(G(X)).",,arg_request,1
This could be a possibility to remove the noise you have when doing multi-step operations (and potentially go way beyond 4 steps).,,arg_fact,0
"Also, G could be used to check whether you obtain the expected formula after 4 steps, which would be a more informative information than the L2 distance between the resulting embedding and the embedding of the final formula.",,arg_request,1
"Overall, the model is a bit complicated (e.g. question 1.), but the results are promising, the paper is well written, and the ability to manipulate formula embeddings is probably going to be useful in the context of theorem proving.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper studies the properties of SGD as a function of batch size and learning rate.,,arg_structuring,0
Authors argue that SGD has two regimes:  a noise dominated regime (small batch size) and curvature dominated regime (large batch size).,,arg_structuring,0
Authors conduct through numerical experiments highlighting how learning rate changes as a function of batch size (initially linear growth and then saturates).,,arg_structuring,0
The critical contribution of this work appears to be the observation that large batch size can be worse than small under same number of steps demonstrating implicit regularization of small batch size.,,arg_structuring,0
The two regime claim of the paper is not really novel.,,arg_evaluative,0
These regimes are fairly well covered by previous works (e.g. Belkin et al as well as others).,,arg_evaluative,0
"When it comes to experiments, constant epoch budget is also fairly well understood and the behavior in Figure 1 is not really surprising (as the eventual training performance gets worse with large batches).",,arg_evaluative,0
The interesting part in my opinion is the experiments on constant steps.,,arg_evaluative,0
Authors verify large batch size reduces test accuracy while improving train.,,arg_evaluative,0
I believe these experiments are novel and the results are interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides CIFAR 10, authors test this hypothesis in two other datasets while tuning the learning rate.",,arg_fact,0
"On the other hand, contribution is somewhat incremental given observations made by related literature (Keskar et al and others).",,arg_evaluative,0
Some remarks:,,arg_structuring,0
"1) In Table 1, batch size 16k has effective LR of 32.",,arg_fact,0
However in Figure 1c SGD with momentum at batch size 8k uses an effective LR of 4.,,arg_request,1
Can you explain this inconsistency i.e. why is there such a huge jump from 4 to 32 (in reality we expect the effective LR to stay constant in the curvature regime).,,arg_request,1
I also understand that one is constant epoch and other is constant step.,,arg_fact,0
However 4 to 32 seems a bit inconsistent.,,arg_request,1
2) Does momentum help in constant step budget (with sufficiently large steps so that training loss is small)?,,arg_request,1
"3) Readability: Consider explaining what is meant by ""warm-up"", ""epoch budget"", ""step budget"" clearly and upfront.",,arg_request,1
"The authors propose to meta-learn, using MAML, the mean of an elementwise, input-dependent, multiplicative noise to improve generalization in few-shot learning.",,arg_structuring,0
The motivation is that meta-learning the noise allows to learn how to best perturb examples in order to improve generlization.,,arg_structuring,0
"This claim is supported by ample experimental evidence and comparisons against many baselines, as well as additional ablation studies w.r.t design choices of the algorithm itself.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is well written and easy to read.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Consequently, I think this is a nice paper and should be accepted.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Edit (leaving everything else unchanged for now): After reading R3's assessment, I agree with them that it's worrying that the Deterministic Meta-Dropout performs better than baseline MAML - maybe it's an effect of a larger number of parameters in the model?",,arg_request,1

This paper presents a method for unsupervised representation learning of speech.,,arg_structuring,0
"The idea is to first learn discrete representation (vector quantization is done by Gumbel softmax or k-means) from audio samples with contrastive prediction coding type objective, and then perform BERT-style pre-training (borrowed from NLP).",,arg_structuring,0
"The BERT features are used as inputs to ASR systems, rather than the usual log-mel features.",,arg_structuring,0
"The idea, which combines those of previous work (wav2vec and BERT) synergetically, is intuitive and clearly presented, significant improvements over log-mel and wav2vec were achieved on ASR benchmarks WSJ and TIMIT.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Based on these merits, I suggest this paper to be accepted.",,arg_evaluative,0
"On the other hand, I would suggest directions for investigation and improvements as follows.",,arg_structuring,0
"1. While I understand that vector quantization makes the use of NLP-style BERT-training possible (as the inputs to NLP models are discrete tokens),  there are potential disadvantages as well.",,arg_fact,0
"One observation from the submission is that the token set may need to very large (from tens of thousands to millions) for the system to work well, making the BERT training computationally expensive (I noticed that the BERT model is trained on 128 GPUs)",,arg_evaluative,0
.,,none,0
"Also, without BERT pre-training, using directly the discrete tokens seems to consistently give worse performance for ASR.",,arg_fact,0
I think some more motivations or explorations (what kind of information did BERT learn) are needed to understand why that is the case.,,arg_request,1
"2. Besides the computational expensive-ness of the three-step approach (vector quantization, BERT, acoustic model training), the combined model complexity is large because these steps do not share neural network architecture.",,arg_evaluative,0
"A more economical approach is to use BERT-trained model as initialization for acoustic model training, which is the classical way how RBMs pre-training were used in ASR.",,arg_request,1
3. One concern I have with discrete representation is how robust they are wrt different dataset.,,arg_evaluative,0
The ASR datasets used in this work are relatively clean (but there does exists domain difference between them).,,arg_fact,0
"It remains to see how the method performs with more acoustically-challenging speech data, and how universally useful the learned features are (as is the case for BERT in NLP).",,arg_fact,0
"4. Another curious question is whether the features would still provide as much improvement when a stronger ASR system than AutoSeg (e.g., Lattice-free MMI) is used.",,arg_request,1
"Overall, while I think the computational cost of the proposed method is high, rendering it less practical at this point, I believe the approach has potential and the result obtained so far is already significant.",,arg_evaluative,0
In this paper the authors introduce a new technique for softmax inference.,,arg_structuring,0
"In a multiclass setting, the idea is to take the output of a NN and turn it into a gating function to choose one expert.",,arg_structuring,0
"Then, given the expert, output a particular category.",,arg_structuring,0

The second level of sparsity comes from every expert only outputting a limited set of output categories.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper is easy to understand but several sections (starting from section 2) could use an english language review (e.g. ""search right"" -> ""search for the right"", ""predict next word"" -> ""predict the next word"", ...) In section 3, can you be more specific about the gains in training versus inference time?",,arg_request,1
I believe the results all relate to inference but it would be good to get an overview of the impact of training time as well.,,arg_request,1
You motivate some of the work by the fact that the experts have overlapping outputs.,,arg_fact,0

This paper builds a new graph convolutional network (GCN) based on hyperbolic representations of the graph nodes: all latent representations of the nodes are points on Poincare disks.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors adapted the Hyperbolic Neural Networks by Ganea et al. (2018) into the Kipf & Welling's (2016) version of GCN.,,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, the authors variated the right matrix multiplication in GCN with Ganea et al.'s Mobius matrix-vector multiplication (that can be regarded as a transformation between two Poincare disks).",,arg_structuring,0
"Moreover, as a non-trivial adaptation, the author defined the left matrix multiplication in GCN (that can be regarded as a weighted linear combination of several points on the same Poincare disk) with Ungar's (2010) weighted barycenter, which is from computational geometry but not the machine learning community.",,arg_structuring,0
"The resulting method is tested on a toy problem and semi-supervised node classification of commonly used datasets, showing the possibility of improvement.",,arg_structuring,0
"This is a practical contribution but not a theoretical contribution, as there is no main theorem (or equivalent statements), and the main novelty is on using Ungar's (2010) weighted barycenter to perform neighborhood features aggregations.",,arg_structuring,0
There are some general discussions on how to adapt gyrovector space theory into spherical spaces.,,arg_structuring,0
This is interesting but no formal results are presented.,,arg_structuring,0
I vote for rejection for four major weaknesses explained as follows.,,arg_evaluative,0
(1) The experimental results cannot show the usefulness of the proposed GCN.,,arg_evaluative,0
The results on real datasets are similar to the regular GCN.,,arg_evaluative,0
"As the authors themselves remarked, ""it can be seen that our models sometimes outperform the two Euclidean GCN"".",,arg_structuring,0
"The experimental settings, e.g. how the train:test datasets are split, and hyperparameter settings, are not clearly given.",,arg_evaluative,0
(2) The method is not well motivated.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The motivation, based on the writing, is that constant curvature spaces are more general where the computation is easy to handle.",,arg_structuring,0
This is too general and not enough as a motivation.,,arg_evaluative,0
"After reading, the reviewer cannot understand why the user should bother to use hyperbolic representations that are more complex to compute in GCNs, given that the experimental results are roughly the same.",,arg_evaluative,0
(3) A large body of graph neural network literature is omitted.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors start from a very high-level description of machine learning in constant curvature spaces.,,arg_fact,0
Such high-level introductions require more comprehensive literatures to support.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In the first mentioning of Graph Neural Networks, the authors only cited Kipf & Welling's GCN.",,arg_fact,0
This is misleading.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, the original GNN, ChebNet, etc. that leads to GCN can be mentioned.",,arg_request,1
"The reviewer recommends the authors to read some literature review of the topic of GCN and re-organize the references, and use search engines to have a better view on the state of the art of (hyperbolic) geometric theories and graph convolutional networks.",,arg_request,1
This is a thriving area that requires a careful literature review.,,arg_request,1
(4) The writing quality is not satisfactory.,,arg_evaluative,0
Here are a few examples: The ICLR citation style needs to use sometimes \citep.,,arg_evaluative,0

"For the bidirectional training, did the ratios of the losses (L_z, L_y, L_x) have to be changed, or the iterations of forward/backward trainings have to be changed (e.g., 1 forward, 1 backward vs. 2 forward, 1 backward)?",,none,0
"This question comes from my observation that the nature of the losses, especially for L_y vs. L_y,L_x (i.e., SL vs. USL) seem to be different.",,arg_fact,0
3.	“we find it advantageous to pad both the in- and output of the network with equal number of zeros”: Is this to effectively increase the intermediate network dimensions?,,arg_request,1
"Also, does this imply that for both forward and inverse process those zero-padded entries always come out to be zero?",,arg_request,1
"It seems that there needs some way to enforce them to be zero to ensure that the propagation happens only among the entries belonging to the variables of interests (x, y and z).",,arg_fact,0
4.	It seems that most of the experiments are done in relatively small dimensional data.,,arg_structuring,0

[Summary]:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper tackles the problem of automatic robot design.,,arg_structuring,0
The most popular approach to doing this has been evolutionary methods which work by evolving morphology of agents in a feed-forward manner using a propagation and mutation rules.,,arg_structuring,0
This is a non-differentiable process and relies on maintaining a large pool of candidates out of which best ones are chosen with the highest fitness.,,arg_structuring,0
"In robot design for a given task using rewards, training each robot design using RL with rewards is an expensive process and not scalable.",,arg_structuring,0
This paper uses graph network to train each morphology using RL.,,arg_structuring,0
"Thereby, allowing the controller to share parameters and reuse information across generations.",,arg_structuring,0
This expedites the score function evaluation improving the time complexity of the evolutionary process.,,arg_structuring,0
[Strengths]:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper shows some promise when graph network-based controllers augmented with evolutionary algorithms.,,arg_evaluative,0
Paper is quite easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
[Weaknesses and Clarifications]:,,arg_structuring,0
=> Robot design area has been explored extensively in classical work of Sims (1994) etc. using ES.,,arg_fact,0
"Given that, the novelty of the paper is fairly incremental as it uses NerveNet to evaluate fitness and ES for the main design search.",,arg_evaluative,0
=> Environment: The experimental section of the paper can be further improved.,,arg_request,1
"The approach is evaluated only in three cases: fish, walker, cheetah. Can it be applied to more complex morphologies? Humanoid etc. maybe?",,arg_request,1
=> Baselines: The comparison provided in the paper is weak.,,arg_evaluative,0
"At first, it compares to random graph search and ES.",,arg_structuring,0
But there are better baselines possible.,,arg_evaluative,0
One such example would be to have a network for each body part and share parameters across each body part.,,arg_fact,0
"This network takes some identifying information (ID, shape etc.) about body part as input.",,arg_fact,0
"As more body parts are added, more such network modules can be added.",,arg_fact,0
How would the given graph network compare to this?,,arg_request,1
This baseline can be thought of a shared parameter graph with no message passing.,,arg_fact,0
=> The results shown in Figure-4 (Section-4.2) seems unclear to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
"As far as I understand, the model starts with hand-engineered design and then finetuned using evolutionary process.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, the original performance of the hand-engineered design is surprisingly bad (see first data point in any plot in Figure-4).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Does the controller also start from scratch? If so, why? Also, it is not clear what is the meaning of generations if the graph is fixed, can't it be learned altogether at once?",,arg_request,1
[Recommendation]:,,arg_structuring,0
I request the authors to address the comments raised above.,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, this is a reasonable paper but experimental section needs much more attention.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This paper builds upon the assumption that GANs successfully approximate the data manifold, and uses this assumption to regularize semi-supervised learning process.",,arg_structuring,0
The proposed regularization strategy enforces that a discriminator or a given classifier should be invariant to small perturbations on the data manifold z. It is empirically shown that naively enforcing such a constraint by randomly adding noise to z could lead to under-smoothing or over-smoothing in some cases which can harm the final classification performance.,,arg_structuring,0
"Consequently, the proposed regularization technique takes a step of tunable size in the direction of the manifold gradient, which has the effect of smoothing along the direction of the gradient while ignoring its norm.",,arg_structuring,0
"Extensive experiments have been conducted, showing that the proposed approach",,arg_structuring,0
"outperforms or is comparable with recent state-of-the-art approaches on cifar 10, especially in presence of fewer labelled data points.",,none,0
"On SVHN however, the proposed approach fails in comparison with (Kumar et al 2017) but performs better than other approaches.",,arg_structuring,0
"Furthermore, it has been shown that adding the proposed manifold regularization technique to the training of GAN greatly improves the image quality of generated images (in terms of FID scores and inception scores).",,arg_structuring,0
"Also, by combining the proposed regularizer with a classical supervised classifier (via pre-training a GAN and using it for regularization) decreases classification error by 2 to 3%.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, it has also been shown that after training a GAN using the manifold regularization, the algorithm is able to produce similar images giving a low enough perturbation of the data manifold z.",,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, this paper is well written and show significant improvements especially for image generation.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, the novelty is rather limited as similar ideas have been undertaken (e.g., Mescheder et al 2018), but in different contexts.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper would be improved if the following points are taken into account:,,arg_structuring,0
A comparison with Graph Convolutional Network based techniques seems appropriate (e.g. Kipf and Welling 2017).,,arg_request,1
How do the FID/Inception improvements compare to (Mescheder et al 2018)?,,arg_request,1
It would be interesting to discuss why the FID score for SVHN gets worse in presence of 1000 labels.,,arg_request,1
Although there is a clear improvement in FID scores for Cifar10.,,arg_fact,0
It would be informative to show the generated images w/ and w/o manifold regularization.,,arg_request,1
More analysis should be provided on why (Kumar et al 2017) perform so well on SVHN.,,arg_request,1
It should be stated that bold values in tables do not represent best results (as it is usually the case) but rather results for the proposed approach.,,arg_request,1
"The paper presents an approach to extract a character from a video and then maneuver that character in the plane, optionally with other backgrounds.",,arg_structuring,0
"The character is then redrawn into the background with a neural net, and all of this is done in real time.",,arg_structuring,0
"All in all, this paper was well structured and extensively detailed wrt how it engineered this solution (and why).",,arg_evaluative,0
"If I had a complaint, it would be that I did not learn anything scientifically from the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
"There isn't a tested hypothesis, but rather it's a feat of engineering to get this to work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Those are important as well for the field, and I suspect that this direction could be pushed a lot more.",,arg_other,0
"For example, it's not close to getting realistic spatial movement relative to the plane nor is the control that impressive wrt limbs.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, as a next-contribution, this work deserves to be seen more widely.",,arg_other,0
"Hence, I rate it as a weak accept.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors introduce the idea of distributed backdoor attacks in the FL framework, in which the dishonest participants in FL add local triggers to their training data to influence the global model to classify triggered images in a desired way.",,arg_structuring,0
"They show empirically that the learned models then are more likely to be successfully forced to misclassified images in which all the local triggers are present at test time, than are models learned using centralized backdoor attacks, where all attackers use the same trigger pattern (one of the same size as the concatenation of the local triggers, to be fair in the comparison).",,arg_structuring,0
"They then demonstrate that because the local triggers cause smaller corruptions in the model coefficients, these distributed attacks survive robust FL training algorithms (namely FoolsGold, and a recent robust regression based method) more often than centralized attacks.",,arg_structuring,0
"Similar experiments are conducted on the Loan text dataset, using appropriate analogs of local triggers, with similar results.",,arg_structuring,0
"The paper contributes a novel model for conducting backdoor attacks in the FL setup, and shows that this model is more successful at attacking when training using robust FL algorithms than the standard centralized backdoor attack model.",,arg_structuring,0
"I lean towards accept, as this is a realistic attack model, and as such can further stimulate research into the robustification of FL model aggregation algorithms.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper tackles the question generation problem from a logical form and proposes an addition called Scratchpad Encoder to the standard seq2seq framework.,,arg_structuring,0
"The new model has been tested on the WebQuestionsSP and the WikiSQL datasets, with both automatic and human evaluation, compared to the baselines with copy and coverage mechanisms.",,arg_structuring,0
Major points:,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, I think this paper is not good enough for an ICLR paper and the presentation is confusing in both its contributions and its technical novelty.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I don’t recommend to accept this paper, at least in the current format.",,arg_fact,0
"The paper states two major contributions (the last paragraph of Introduction), one is the new model Scratchpad Encoder, and the other is “possible to generate a large high quality (SPARQL query, local form) dataset”.",,arg_structuring,0
"For the second contribution, there isn’t any evaluation/justification about the quality of the generated questions and how useful this dataset would be in any KB-QA applications.",,arg_structuring,0
"I believe that this paper is not the first one to study question generation from logical form (cf. Guo et al, 2018 as cited), so it is unclear what is the contribution of this paper in that respect.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For the modeling contribution, although it shows some improvements on the benchmarks and some nice analysis, the paper really doesn’t explain well the intuition of this “write” operation/Scratchpad (also the improvement of Scratchpad vs coverage is relatively limited). Is this something tailored to question generation? Why does it expect to improve on the question generation or it can improve any tasks which build on top of seq2seq+att framework (e.g., machine translation, summarization -- if some results can be shown on the most competitive benchmarks, that would be much more convincing)?",,arg_evaluative,0
In general I find Section 3 pretty difficult to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
What does “keeping notes” mean?,,arg_request,1
"It seems that the goal of this model is to keep updating the encoder hidden vectors (h_0, .., h_T) instead of fixing them at the decoder stage.",,none,0
I think it is necessary to make it clearer how s_{post_read} and attn_copy are computed with the updated {h^i_t} and what u^i is expected to encode.,,arg_evaluative,0
\alpha^i_t and u^i are also pretty complex and it would be good to conduct some ablation analysis.,,arg_request,1
Minor points:,,arg_structuring,0
"- tau Yih et al, 2016 --> Yih et al, 2016",,arg_request,1
- It is unclear why the results on WikiSQL is presented in Appendix. Combining the results on both datasets in the experiments section would be more convincing.,,arg_evaluative,0
- Table 1: Not sure why there is only one model that employs beam search (with beam size = 2) among all the comparisons. It looks strange.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This work presents Backpropamine, a neuromodulated plastic LSTM training regime.",,arg_structuring,0
It extends previous research on differentiable Hebbian plasticity by introducing a neuromodulatory term to help gate information into the Hebbian synapse.,,arg_structuring,0
"The neuromodulatory term is placed under network control, allowing it to be time varying (and hence to be sensitive to the input, for example).",,arg_structuring,0
Another variant proposes updating the Hebbian synapse with modulated exponential average of the Hebbian product.,,arg_structuring,0
"This average is linked to the notion of an eligibility trace, and ties into some recent biological work that shows the role of dopamine in retroactively modulating synaptic plasticity.",,arg_structuring,0
Overall the work is nicely motivated and clearly presented.,,arg_evaluative,0
"There are some interesting ties to biological work -- in particular, to retroactive plasticity phenomena.",,arg_evaluative,0
"There should be sufficient details for a reader to implement this model, thought there are some minor details missing regarding the experimental setup, which will be addressed below.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors test their model on three tasks: cue-award association, maze learning, and Penn Treebank (PTB).",,arg_structuring,0
"In the cue-award association task the retroactive and simple modulation networks perform well, while the non-modulated and non-plastics fail.",,arg_structuring,0
"For the maze navigation task the modulated networks perform better than the non-modulated networks, though the effect is less pronounced.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, on PTB the authors report improvements over baseline LSTMs.",,arg_structuring,0
"One of the main claims of this paper is that neuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task”, and that therefore “differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks”.",,arg_structuring,0
This claim is unfortunately unfounded for a very important reason: the LSTM performance is not at all close to that which can be achieved by LSTMs in general.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors cite such models in the appendix (Melor et al), but claim that “much larger models” are needed, potentially with other mechanisms, such as dropout.",,arg_structuring,0
"Though this may be true, these models still undermine the claim that “neuromodulated plastic LSTMs...outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task”.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This claim is simply not true, and more care is needed in reporting the results here in the wider context of the literature.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, I am left wondering what are considered the parameters of the models -- are only the neuromodulatory terms considered as the additional trainable parameters compared to baseline LSTMs? How are the Hebbian synapses themselves considered in this calculation?",,arg_request,1
"If the Hebbian synapses are not considered, then the authors need a control with matched memory-capacities to account for the extra capacity afforded by the Hebbian synapses.",,arg_request,1
"Given the ties between Hebbian synapses and attention (see Ba et al), an important control here could be an LSTM with Bahdanau (2014) style attention.",,arg_request,1
"Finally, the style (font) of the paper does not adhere to the ICLR style template, and must be changed.",,arg_request,1
"Overall, the ideas presented in the paper are intriguing, and further research down this line is encouraged.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, in its current state the work lacks sufficiently strong baselines to support the paper’s claims; thus, the merits of this approach cannot yet be properly assessed.",,arg_evaluative,0
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
Many prior works have found that the features output by the final layer of neural networks can often be used as informative representations for many tasks despite being trained for one in particular.,,arg_structuring,0
"These feature representations, however, are learned transformations of low-level input representations, e.g. RGB values of an image.",,arg_structuring,0
"In this paper, they aim to learn useful feature representations without meaningful low-level input representations, e.g. just an instance ID.",,arg_structuring,0
"Instead, meaningful representations are learned through gathered triplet comparisons of these IDs, e.g. is instance A more similar to instance B or instance C? Similar existing techniques fall in the realm of learning ordinal embeddings, but this technique demonstrates speed-ups that allow it to scale to large real world datasets.",,arg_structuring,0
The two primary contributions of the paper are given as:,,arg_structuring,0
- a showcase of the power of neural networks as a tool to approximately solve NP-hard optimization problems with discrete inputs,,arg_structuring,0
- a scalable approach for the ordinal embedding problem,,arg_structuring,0
"After experimentation on synthetic data, they compare the effectiveness of their proposed method Ordinal Embedding Neural Network (OENN) against the baseline techniques of Local Ordinal Embedding (LOE) and t-distributed Stochastic Triplet Embedding (TSTE).",,arg_structuring,0
"The test error given by the systems is comparable, but there are clear speed benefits to the proposed method OENN as the other techniques could not be run for a dataset size of 20k, 50k, or 100k.",,arg_structuring,0
"Then, they gathered real-world data using MTurk applied to a subset of ImageNet and applied OENN to learning embeddings of different image instances using only the MTurk triplet information rather than the input RGB input features.",,arg_structuring,0
Decision: Weak Reject,,arg_social,0
"1. Interesting technique to take advantage of neural networks to efficiently learn ordinal embeddings from a set of relationships without a low-level feature representation, but I believe the experiments could be improved.",,arg_evaluative,0
"One of the main advantages of this approach is efficiency, which allows it to be used on large real-world datasets.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The MTurk experiment gives a qualitative picture, but it could be improved with comparisons to pairwise distances learned through alternative means using the RGB image itself (given that images would permit such a comparison).",,arg_evaluative,0
"By this I mean, that you may be able to use relationships learned using conventional triplet methods which use input RGB features as ground truth, and test your learned relationships against those.",,none,0
"However, since quantitative exploration of large real-world datasets may be challenging and expensive to collect, the synthetic experiments could have been more detailed.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The message of synthetic experiments would be stronger if more of them were available and if the comparison between LOE, TSTE, and OENN was made on more of them.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2. I think that the claim that the use of neural networks with discrete inputs can approximately solve NP-hard optimization problems is an exciting one, which likely necessitates more experiments (or theoretical results), but as it stands I don't think it is a fundamentally different conclusion from the fact that this method provides a great scalable solution for the ordinal embedding problem.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This claim can be made secondarily or as motivation for continued exploration along this direction, but I think listing them as two distinct contributions is necessary.",,none,0
Additional feedback:,,arg_structuring,0
"Since quantitative real-world results are challenging to obtain, improved presentation of the qualitative results would be helpful as well.",,arg_evaluative,0
You may be able to show more plots which help display the quality of the embedding space varying with the number of triplets used.,,arg_request,1
"For example, an additional plot after Figure 5 (b) which shows a few scatter plots of points (color coded by class) for training with different numbers of collected triplets.",,none,0
"Also, since it should be fairly easy to distinguish between cars and animals or cars and food, it may be more interesting to focus on the heat-maps from along the block diagonal of Figure 5 (a) and talk about what relationships may have been uncovered within the animal or food subsets.",,arg_evaluative,0
Very minor details:,,arg_structuring,0
"In Figure 5, a legend indicating the relationship between color intensity and distance would be helpful.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In Figure 6 there seem to be unnecessary discrepancies between the y-axis and colorbar of subplots (a) and (b), and keeping those more consistent would improve readability.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper presents 4D convolutional neural networks for video-level representations.,,arg_structuring,0
"To learn long-range evolution of spatio-temporal representation of videos, the authors proposed V4D convolution layer.",,arg_structuring,0
Benchmark on several video classification dataset shows improvement.,,arg_evaluative,0
"1. In section 3.1, the authors selected a snippet from each section, but this was not rigorously defined.",,arg_evaluative,0
Same for action units.,,arg_evaluative,0
"It does intuitively makes sense, but more mathematical definition (e.g., dimensionality) may be needed.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2. In section 3.2, the authors argued that 3D kernel suffers from trade-off between receptive field and cost of computation.",,arg_fact,0
"At the end of the subsection, the authors argue that 4D convolution is just k times larger than 3D kernels, which sounds like contradicting.",,arg_evaluative,0
"3D convolution is already expensive and not scalable, but 4D operation sounds even more expensive and more prohibitive.",,arg_fact,0
"3. In the paper, the authors argued that clip-level feature learning is limited as it is hard to learn long-range spatio-temporal dependency.",,arg_fact,0
"It makes sense, and I expect the proposed model may benefit from its design for long-range spatio-temporal feature learning.",,arg_fact,0
"However, what I see in the experiments is on ~300 frames for Mini-Kinetics and 36-72 frames for Something-Something dataset.",,arg_fact,0
"Assuming that a second is represented with 15-30 frames, this corresponds to 10-20 sec and 1-4 sec, respectively.",,arg_fact,0
I'd say these short videos are still clips.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper presents an interesting idea, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before published on ICLR.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper design a low variance gradient for distributions associated with continuous or discrete random variables.,,arg_structuring,0
The gradient is designed in the way to approximate the  property of reparameterization gradient.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is comprehensive and includes mathematical details.,,arg_structuring,0
I have following comments/questions,,arg_structuring,0
1. What is the \kappa in “variable-nabla” stands for? What is the gradient w.r.t. \kappa?,,arg_evaluative,0
"2. In Eq(8), does the outer expectation w.r.t . y_{-v} be approximated by one sample? If so, it is using the local expectation method.",,arg_evaluative,0
How does that differs from Titsias & Lazaro-Gredilla(2015) both mathematically and experimentally?,,arg_evaluative,0
"3. Assume y_v is M-way categorical distribution, Eq(8) evaluates f by 2*V*M times which can be computationally expensive.",,arg_evaluative,0
What is the computation complexity of GO? How to explain the fast speed shown in the experiments?,,arg_evaluative,0
4. A most simple way to reduce the variance of REINFORCE gradient is to take multiple Monte-Carlo samples at the cost of more computation with multiple function f evaluations.,,arg_fact,0
"Assume GO gradient needs to evaluate f N times, how does the performance compared with the REINFORCE gradient with N Monte-Carlo samples?",,arg_evaluative,0
"5. In the discrete VAE experiment, upon brief checking the results in Grathwohl(2017), it shows validation ELBO for MNIST as (114.32,111.12), OMNIGLOT as (122.11,128.20) from which two cases are better than GO.",,arg_evaluative,0
Does the hyper parameter setting favor the GO gradient in the reported experiments?,,arg_evaluative,0
Error bar may also be needed for comparison.,,arg_request,1
What about the performance of GO gradient in the 2 stochastic layer setting in Grathwohl(2017)?,,arg_evaluative,0
"6. The paper claims GO has less parameters than REBAR/RELAX. But in Figure 9, GO has more severe overfitting. How to explain this contradicts between the model complexity and overfitting?",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposes a few variations on the RGCN model with adding attention to either within relations or across relations.,,arg_structuring,0
Unfortunately the paper falls short in two main areas:,,arg_structuring,0
- novelty: the additions proposed are small modifications to existing algorithms and there are other methods of attention on graphs which have been discussed in the paper but not directly compared to (e.g. this method builds heavily on Velickovic et al 2017),,arg_evaluative,0
"- impact: the results achieved in the experiments are very small improvements compared to the baseline of RGCN (~ +0.01 in two experiments and ~ -0.04 in another) and often these small variations in results can be compensated with better baselines training (e.g. better hyper-params, ...)",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, on a positive note, the paper has been written very well and I really liked the frank discussion on page 8 about results on MUTAG dataset.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper presents a Neural Network based method for learning ordinal embeddings only from triplet comparisons.,,arg_structuring,0
"A nice, easy to read paper, with an original idea.",,arg_evaluative,0

"- for the experiment with Imagenet images, it is not very clear how many pictures are used. Is this number 2500?",,arg_request,1
"- the authors state that they use ""the power of DNNs"" while they are experimenting with a neural network with only 4 layers. While there is no clear line between shallow and deep neural networks, I would argue that a 4 layer NN is rather shallow.",,arg_evaluative,0

"- I don't see a discussion about the downsides of the method (for example, the large number of triplet comparison examples needed for training; and possible methods to overcome this problem).",,arg_request,1
- in section 4.4,,arg_request,1

The paper proposes a recurrent knowledge graph (bipartite graph between entities and location nodes) construction & updating mechanism for entity state tracking datasets such as (two) ProPara tasks and Recipes.,,arg_structuring,0
The model goes through the following three steps: 1) it reads a sentence at each time step t and identifies the location of each entity via machine reading comprehension model such as DrQA (entities are predefined).,,arg_structuring,0
"2) Co-reference module adjusts relationship scores (soft adjacency matrix) among nodes, including possibly new nodes introduced by the MRC model.",,arg_structuring,0
"3) to propagate the relational information across all the nodes, the model performs L layers of LSTM for each entity that attend on other nodes via attention (where the weights come from the adjacency matrix).",,arg_structuring,0
The model repeats the three steps for each sentence.,,arg_structuring,0
"The model is trained by directly supervising for the correct span by the MRC model at each time step, which is possible because the data provides strong supervision for each sentence (not just the answer at the end).",,arg_structuring,0
The model achieves the state of the art in the two tasks of ProPara and Recipes dataset.,,arg_structuring,0
Strengths: The paper provides an elegant solution for tracking relationship between entities as time (sentence) progresses.,,arg_evaluative,0
I also agree with the authors that this line of work (dynamic KG construction and modification) is an important area of research.,,arg_evaluative,0
"While the model shares a similar spirit to EntNet, I think the model has enough distinctions / contributions, especially given that it outperforms EntNet by a large margin.",,arg_evaluative,0
The model also obtains non-trivial improvement over previous SOTA models.,,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses: Paper could have been written better. I had hard time understanding it.,,arg_evaluative,0
The notations are overall confusing and not explained well.,,arg_evaluative,0
Also there are a few unclear parts which I discuss in questions below.,,arg_structuring,0
Questions:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Are e_{i,t} and lambda_{i,t} vectors?",,arg_request,1
Scalars?,,none,0
Abstract node notations? It is not clear in the model section.,,none,0
"Also, it took me a long time to figure out that ‘i’ is used to index each entity (it is mentioned later).",,arg_evaluative,0
2. The paper says v_i (initial representation of each entity) is obtained by looking at the contextualized representations (LSTM outputs) of entity mention in the context.,,arg_structuring,0
What happens if there are multiple mentions in the text? Which one does it look at?,,arg_request,1
"3. For the LSTM in the graph update, why does it have only one input? Shouldn’t it have two inputs, one for previous hidden state and the other for input?",,arg_request,1
"4. Regarding Recipe experiments, the paper says it reaches a better performance than the baseline using just 10k examples out of 60k.",,arg_structuring,0
"This is great, but could you also report the number when the full dataset is used?",,arg_request,1
5. What does it mean that in training time the model “updates” the location node representation with the encoding of correct span. Do you mean you use the encoding instead?,,arg_request,1
"6. For ProPara task 2, what threshold did you choose to obtain the P/R/F1 score?",,arg_request,1
Is it the threshold that maximizes F1?,,arg_request,1
The paper introduces a generative model for video prediction.,,arg_structuring,0
The originality stems from a new training criterion which combines a VAE and a GAN criteria.,,arg_structuring,0
"At training time, the GAN and the VAE are trained simultaneously with a shared generator; at test time, prediction conditioned on initial frames is performed by sampling from a latent distribution and generating the next frames via an enhanced conv LST .",,arg_structuring,0
Evaluations are performed on two movement video datasets classically used for benchmarking  this task - several quantitative evaluation criteria are considered.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper clearly states the objective and provides a nice general description of the method.,,arg_evaluative,0
The proposed model extends previous work by adding an adversarial loss to a VAE video prediction model.,,arg_evaluative,0
The evaluation compares different variants of this model to two recent VAE baselines.,,arg_evaluative,0
A special emphasis is put on the quantitative evaluation: several criteria are introduced for characterizing different properties of the models with a focus on diversity.,,arg_evaluative,0
"w.r.t. the baselines, the model behaves well for the “realistic” and “diversity” measures.",,none,0
The results are more mitigated for measures of accuracy.,,none,0
"As for the qualitative evaluation, the model corrects the blurring effect of the reference SV2P baseline, and produces quite realistic predictions on these datasets.",,arg_evaluative,0
The difference with the other reference model (SVG) is less clear.,,arg_evaluative,0
"While the general description of the model is clear, details are lacking.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would probably help to position the VAE component more precisely w.r.t. one of the two baselines, by indicating the differences.",,arg_evaluative,0
This would also help to explain the difference of performance/ behavior  w.r.t. these models (Fig. 5).,,arg_fact,0
"It seems that the discriminator takes a whole sequence as input, but some precision on how this done could be added.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Similarly, you did not indicate what the deterministic version of your model is.",,arg_evaluative,0
The generator model with its warping component makes a strong hypothesis on the nature of the videos: it seems especially well suited for translations or for other simple geometric transformations characteristics of the benchmarking videos .,,arg_evaluative,0
Could you comment on the importance of this component? Did you test the model on other types of videos where this hypothesis is less relevant?,,arg_request,1
It seems that the baseline SVG makes use of simpler ConLSTM for example.,,arg_fact,0
The description of the generator in the appendix is difficult to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I missed the point in the following sentence: “For each one-step prediction, the network has the freedom to choose to copy pixels from the previous frame, used transformed versions of the previous frame, or to synthesize pixels from scratch” .",,none,0
"Also, it is not clear from the discussion on z, whether sampling is performed once for each video of for each frame.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall, the paper proposes an extension of VAE based video prediction models and produces an extensive evaluation.",,arg_structuring,0
"While the model seems to perform well, the originality and the improvement w.r.t. baselines are somewhat limited.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This paper proposed to train a network with training curves and corresponding parameters, and use policy search to find optimal parameter to replace hundreds or thousands of training in real case scenario, and it is clearly much faster using the trained network to infer parameters, instead of tuning the network manually.",,arg_structuring,0
"The first point would be: what's the meaning of synthetically generating training curves other than proving that transformer achieves good performance in modeling discrete distribution? Most practical problems would not have the same distribution as the previously gathered public dataset, thus the data is not representative, and synthetic training curves just does not make sence.",,arg_evaluative,0

Paper summary - This paper extends the differentiable plasticity framework of Miconi et al. (2018) by dynamically modulating the plasticity learning rate.,,arg_structuring,0
This is accomplished via an output unit of the network which defines the plasticity learning rate for the next timestep.,,arg_structuring,0
A variation on this dynamic learning rate related to eligibility traces is also proposed.,,arg_structuring,0
Both dynamic modulation variations strikingly outperform non-plastic and plastic non-modulated recurrent networks on a cue-reward association task with high-dimensional cues.,,arg_structuring,0
The methods marginally outperform plastic non-modulated recurrent networks on a 9x9 water maze task.,,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, the authors show that adding dynamic plasticity to a small LSTM without dropout improves performance on Penn Treebank.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper motivates dynamic plasticity by analogy to the hypothesized role of dopamine in reward-driven learning in humans and animals.,,arg_structuring,0
Clarity -  The paper is very clear and well written.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The introduction provides useful insights, motivates the work convincingly, and provides interesting connections to past work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Originality - I don't know of any other work that models the role of dopamine in quite this way, or that applies dynamic plasticity modulation in settings like these.",,arg_evaluative,0
Quality - The experiments are well chosen and seem technically sound.,,arg_evaluative,0
Significance - The results show that meta-learning by gradient descent to modulate the plasticity learning rate is a promising direction -- a significant contribution in my view.,,arg_evaluative,0
Other Comments - The citation to Zaremba et al. in Table 1 made it seem like the perplexity result on that line of the table was directly from Zaremba et al's paper. I'd recommend removing the citation from that line to avoid confusion.,,arg_request,1
"One thing I would have loved to see from this paper is a comparison of modulated-plasticity LSTMs with the sota from Melis et al., 2017.",,arg_request,1
I gather that Experiment 3 presents small LSTMs without recurrent dropout instead because combining plasticity and dropout proved challenging (or at least the authors haven't tried it yet).,,arg_fact,0
I think the paper is solid as-is; positive results in this comparison would take it to the next level.,,arg_request,1
Questions:,,arg_structuring,0
Why were zero-sequences necessary in Experiment 1?,,arg_request,1
"This aspect of the task seems somewhat contrived, and it makes me wonder whether the striking failure of the non-modulated RNNs depends on this detail.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Perhaps the authors could clarify on what a confounding ""time-locked scheduling strategy"" would look like in this task?",,arg_request,1

This paper proposes an extension to the continual learning framework using existing variational continual learning (VCL) as the base method.,,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, it proposes to use the weight of evidence (WE) (from Zintgraf et al 2017) for each task.",,arg_structuring,0
"Firstly, this WE can be used to visualize the learned model (as used in Zintgraf et. al. 2017).",,arg_structuring,0
The novelty of this paper is:,,arg_structuring,0
1. to use this WE from the current task to generate a silence map (by smoothing the WE) for the next task.,,arg_structuring,0
This is interpreted the learned the learned attention region.,,arg_structuring,0
Such an approach is named Interpretable COntinual Learning (ICL),,arg_structuring,0
2. The paper proposes a metric for the saliency map naming FSM which is an extension of existing metric SSR.,,arg_structuring,0
"The extension is to take pixel count to compute the area instead of using rectangular region area, as well as taking the distance between pixels into account.",,arg_structuring,0
This metric can be used to evaluate the level of catastrophic forgetting.,,arg_structuring,0
Pro:,,arg_structuring,0
"In general, the idea is very intuitive and make sense.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper also demonstrates superior performance with the proposed method on continual learning on all classic tasks comparing with VCL and EWC.,,arg_evaluative,0
The presentation is very easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
It seems like a valid and flexible extension that can be used in other continual learning frameworks.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
The theoretical contribution is very limited.,,arg_evaluative,0
The work is rather incremental from current state-of-the-art methods.,,arg_evaluative,0
There should be a better discussion of related work on the topic.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper currently only mentions the most related work for the proposed method,  using the whole section 2 to describe VCL and use section 3 to describe FSM and half of section 5 to describe SSR.",,arg_evaluative,0
A general overview of related work in these directions are needed.,,arg_request,1

Overview:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper proposes modifications to the original Differentiable Neural Computer architecture in three ways.,,arg_structuring,0
First by introducing a masked content-based addressing which dynamically induces a key-value separation,,arg_structuring,0
.,,none,0
"Second, by modifying the de-allocation system by also multiplying the memory contents by a retention vector before an update",,arg_structuring,0
.,,none,0
"Finally, the authors propose a modification in the link distribution, through renormalization.",,arg_structuring,0
They provide some theoretical motivation and empirical evidence that it helps avoiding memory aliasing.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors test their approach in the some algorithm task from the DNC paper (Copy, Associative Recall and Key-Value Retrieval), and also in the bAbi dataset.",,arg_structuring,0
"Strengths: Overall I think the paper is well-written, and proposes simple adaptions to the DNC architecture which are theoretically grounded and could be effective for improving general performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Although the experimental results seem promising when comparing the modified architecture to the original DNC, in my opinion there are a few fundamental problems in the empirical session (see weakness discussion bellow).",,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses: Not all model modifications are studied in all the algorithmic tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, in the associative recall and key-value retrieval only DNC and DNC + masking are studied.",,arg_structuring,0
"For the bAbi task, although there is a significant improvement (43%) in the mean error rate compared to the original DNC, it's important to note that performance in this task has improved a lot since the DNC paper was release. Since this is the only non-toy task in the paper, in my opinion, the authors have to discuss current SOTA on it, and have to cite, for example the universal transformer[1], entnet[2], relational nets [3], among others architectures that shown recent advances on this benchmark.",,arg_request,1
"Moreover, the sparse DNC (Rae el at., 2016) is already a much better performant in this task.",,arg_fact,0
"(mean error DNC: 16.7 \pm 7.6, DNC-MD (this paper) 9.5 \pm 1.6, sparse DNC 6.4 \pm 2.5).",,none,0
"Although the authors mention in the conclusion that it's future work to merge their proposed changes into the sparse DNC, it is hard to know how relevant the improvements are, knowing that there are much better baselines for this task.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It would also be good if besides the mean error rates, they reported best runs chosen by performance on the validation task, and number of the tasks solve (with < 5% error) as it is standard in this dataset.",,arg_request,1
Smaller Notes.,,arg_structuring,0
"1) In the abstract, I find the message for motivating the masking from the sentence  ""content based look-up results... which is not present in the key and need to be retrieved.""  hard to understand by itself. When I first read the abstract, I couldn't understand what the authors wanted to communicate with it. Later in 3.1 it became clear.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2) page 3, beta in that equation is not defined",,none,0
3) First paragraph in page 5 uses definition of acronyms DNC-MS and DNC-MDS before they are defined.,,arg_evaluative,0
"4) Table 1 difference between DNC and DNC (DM) is not clear. I am assuming it's the numbers reported in the paper, vs the author's implementation?",,arg_request,1
"5)In session 3.1-3.3, for completeness. I think it would be helpful to explicitly compare the equations from the original DNC paper with the new proposed ones.",,arg_request,1
--------------,,arg_structuring,0
Post rebuttal update: I think the authors have addressed my main concern points and I am updating my score accordingly.,,arg_structuring,0
This paper studies the dynamics-based curiosity intrinsic reward where the agent is rewarded highly in states where the forward dynamic prediction errors are high in an embedding space (either due to complexity of the state or unfamiliarity).,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall I like the paper, it's systematic and follows a series of practical considerations and step-by-step experimentations.",,arg_evaluative,0
One of the main area which is missing in the paper is the comparison to two other class of RL methods: count-based exploration and novelty search.,,arg_evaluative,0
"While the section 4 has a discussion on related papers, there's no systematic experimental comparison across these methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
"In sec. 4, there's a reference to an initial set of experiments with count-based methods without much details.",,arg_request,1
Another area of improvement is the experiments around VAE.,,arg_request,1
"While the paper shows experimentally that they aren't as successful as the RFs or IDFs, there's no further discussion on the reasons for poor performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
Also it's not clear from the details in the paper what are the architectures for the VAE and RFs (there's a reference to the code but would've been better to have sufficient details in the paper).,,arg_request,1
An interesting area for future work could be on early stopping techniques for embedding training - it seems that RFs perform well without any training while in some scenarios the IDFs work overall the best.,,arg_request,1
So it would be interesting to explore how much training is needed for the embedding model.,,arg_request,1
RFs are never trained and IDFs are continuously trained.,,arg_fact,0
So maybe somewhere in between could be the sweet spot with training for a short while and then fixing the features.,,arg_fact,0
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper proposes Direct Sparse Optimization (DSO)-NAS, which is a method to obtain neural architectures on specific problems, at a reasonable computational cost.",,arg_structuring,0
"The main idea is to treat all architectures as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each architecture is realized by a subgraph.",,arg_structuring,0
"All architectures in the search space thus share their weights, like ENAS (Pham et al 2018) and DARTS (Liu et al 2018a).",,arg_structuring,0
The DAG’s edges can be pruned via a sparsity regularization term.,,arg_structuring,0
The optimization objective of DSO-NAS is thus:,,arg_structuring,0
"Accuracy + L2-regularization(W) + L1-sparsity(\lambda),",,arg_structuring,0
where W is the shared weights and \lambda specifies which edges in the DAG are used.,,arg_structuring,0
There are 3 phases of optimization:,,arg_structuring,0
1. All edges are activated and the shared weights W are trained using normal SGD.,,arg_structuring,0
Note that this step does not involve \lambda.,,arg_structuring,0
"2. \lambda is trained using Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG, Huang and Wang 2018).",,arg_structuring,0
3. The best architecture is selected and retrained from scratch.,,arg_structuring,0
This procedure works for all architectures and objectives.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, DSO-NAS further proposes to incorporate the computation expense of architectures into step (2) above, leading to their found architectures having fewer parameters and a smaller FLOP counts.",,arg_structuring,0
"Their experiments confirm all the hypotheses (DSO-NAS can find architectures, having small FLOP counts, having good performances on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet).",,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
1. Regularization by sparsity is a neat idea.,,arg_evaluative,0
2. The authors claim to be the first NAS algorithm to perform direct search on ImageNet.,,arg_structuring,0
"Honestly, I cannot confirm this claim (not sure if I have seen all NAS papers out there), but if it is the case, then it is impressive.",,arg_evaluative,0
3. Incorporating architecture costs into the search objective is nice.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, this contribution seems to be orthogonal to the sparsity regularization, which, I suppose, is the main point of the paper.",,arg_other,0
Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
1. Some experimental details are missing. I’m going to list them here:,,arg_structuring,0
- Was the auxiliary tower used during the training of the shared weights W?,,arg_request,1
"- Figure 4 does not illustrate M=4 and N=4, e.g. which operation belongs to which layer?",,arg_request,1
"- Did the experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet use the cosine learning rate schedule [1]? If or if not, either way, you should specify it in a revised version of this paper, e.g. did you use the cosine schedule in the first 120 steps to train the shared parameters W, did you use it in the retraining from scratch?",,arg_request,1
"- In Section 3.3, it is written that “The sparse regularization of \lambda induces great difficulties in optimization”.",,arg_structuring,0
"This triggers my curiosity of which difficulty is it? It would be nice to see this point more elaborated, and to see ablation study experiments.",,arg_request,1
2. Missed citation: MnasNet [2] also incorporates the cost of architectures in their search process.,,arg_request,1
"On ImageNet, your performance is similar to theirs.",,arg_fact,0
I think this will be a good comparison.,,arg_request,1
"3. The paper has some grammatical errors. I obviously missed many, but here are the one I found:",,arg_structuring,0
"- Section 3.3: “Different from pruning, which the search space is usually quite limited”. “which” should be “whose”?",,arg_request,1
- Section 4.4.1: “DSO-NAS can also search architecture [...]”  -> “DSO-NAS can also search for architectures [...]”,,arg_request,1

The paper explores how well different visual reasoning models can learn systematic generalization on a simple binary task.,,arg_structuring,0
"They create a simple synthetic dataset, involving asking if particular types of objects are in a spatial relation to others.",,arg_structuring,0
"To test generalization, they lower the ratio of observed  combinations of objects in the training data.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors show the result that tree structured neural module networks generalize very well, but other strong visual reasoning approaches do not.",,arg_structuring,0
They also explore whether appropriate structures can be learned.,,arg_structuring,0
"I think this is a very interesting area to explore, and the paper is clearly written and presented.",,arg_structuring,0
"As the authors admit, the main result is not especially surprising.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I think everyone agrees that we can design models that show particular kinds of generalization by carefully building inductive bias into the architecture, and that it's easy to make these work on the right toy data.",,arg_fact,0
"However, on less restricted data, more general architectures seem to show better generalization (even if it is not systematic).",,arg_fact,0
What I really want this paper to explore is when and why this happens.,,arg_request,1
"Even on synthetic data, when do or don't we see generalization (systematic or otherwise) from NMNs/MAC/FiLM?",,arg_request,1
MAC in particular seems to have an inductive bias that might make some forms of systematic generalization possible.,,arg_fact,0
"It might be the case that their version of NMN can only really do well on this specific task, which would be less interesting.",,arg_fact,0
"All the models show very high training accuracy, even if they do not show systematic generalization.",,arg_structuring,0
"That suggests that from the point of view of training, there are many equally good solutions, which suggests a number of interesting questions. If you did large numbers of training runs, would the models occasionally find the right solution? Could you somehow test for if a given trained model will show systematic generalization?",,arg_request,1
"Is there any way to help the models find the ""right"" (or better) solutions - e.g. adding regularization, or changing the model size?",,arg_request,1
"Overall, I do think the paper has makes a contribution in experimentally showing a setting where tree-structured NMNs can show better systematic generalization than other visual reasoning approaches.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I feel like the main result is a bit too predictable, and for acceptance I'd like to see a much more detailed exploration of the questions around systematic generalization.",,arg_request,1
The paper examines an architectural feature in GAN generators -- self-modulation -- and presents empirical evidence supporting the claim that it helps improve modeling performance.,,arg_fact,0
The self-modulation mechanism itself is implemented via FiLM layers applied to all convolutional blocks in the generator and whose scaling and shifting parameters are predicted as a function of the noise vector z.,,arg_fact,0
"Performance is measured in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for models trained with and without self-modulation on a fairly comprehensive range of model architectures (DCGAN-based, ResNet-based), discriminator regularization techniques (gradient penalty, spectral normalization), and datasets (CIFAR10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, ImageNet).",,arg_fact,0
The takeaway is that self-modulation is an architectural feature that helps improve modeling performance by a significant margin in most settings.,,arg_fact,0
"An ablation study is also performed on the location where self-modulation is applied, showing that it is beneficial across all locations but has more impact towards the later layers of the generator.",,arg_fact,0
"I am overall positive about the paper: the proposed idea is simple, but is well-explained and backed by rigorous evaluation.",,arg_evaluative,0
Here are the questions I would like the authors to discuss further:,,arg_structuring,0
- The proposed approach is a fairly specific form of self-modulation.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In general, I think of self-modulation as a way for the network to interact with itself, which can be a local interaction, like for squeeze-and-excitation blocks.",,arg_fact,0
"In the case of this paper, the self-interaction allows the noise vector z to interact with various intermediate features across the generation process, which for me appears to be different than allowing intermediate features to interact with themselves.",,arg_fact,0
"This form of noise injection at various levels of the generator is also close in spirit to what BigGAN employs, except that in the case of BigGAN different parts of the noise vector are used to influence different parts of the generator.",,arg_fact,0
Can you clarify how you view the relationship between the approaches mentioned above?,,arg_request,1
"- It’s interesting to me that the ResNet architecture performs better with self-modulation in all settings, considering that one possible explanation for why self-modulation is helpful is that it allows the “information” contained in the noise vector to better propagate to and influence different parts of the generator.",,arg_fact,0
"ResNets also have this ability to “propagate” the noise signal more easily, but it appears that having a self-modulation mechanism on top of that is still beneficial.",,arg_fact,0
I’m curious to hear the authors’ thoughts in this.,,arg_request,1
"- Reading Figure 2b, one could be tempted to draw a correlation between the complexity of the dataset and the gains achieved by self-modulation over the baseline (e.g., Bedroom shows less difference between the two approaches than ImageNet). Do the authors agree with that?",,arg_request,1
The paper is well written and easy to follow. The topic is apt.,,arg_evaluative,0
I don’t have any comments except the following ones.,,arg_structuring,0
"Lemma 2.4, Point 1: The proof is confusing.",,arg_evaluative,0
Consider the one variable vector case.,,arg_fact,0
"Assuming that there is only one variable w, then \nabla L(w) is not perpendicular to w in general.",,arg_fact,0
"The Rayleigh quotient example L(w)  = w’*A*w/ (w’*w) for a symmetric matrix A, then \nabla L(w) = (2/w’*w)(Aw - L(w)*w), which is not perpendicular to w.",,arg_fact,0

The role of auxiliary tasks is to improve the generalization performance of the principal task of interest.,,arg_structuring,0
"So far, hand-crafted auxiliary tasks are generated, tailored for a problem of interest.",,arg_structuring,0
"The current work addresses a meta-learning approach to automatically generate auxiliary tasks suited to the principal task, without human knowledge.",,arg_structuring,0
The key components of the method are: (1) meta-generator; (2) multi-task evaluator.,,arg_structuring,0
"These two models are trained using the gradient-based meta-learning technique (for instance, MAML).",,arg_structuring,0
"The problem of image classification is considered only, while authors claimed the method can be easily applied to other problems as well.",,arg_evaluative,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
"- To my best knowledge, the idea of applying the meta-learning to the automatic generation of auxiliary tasks is novel.",,arg_evaluative,0

"- The method nicely blends a few components such as self-supervised learning, meta-learning, auxiliary tasks into a single model to tackle the meta auxiliary learning.",,arg_evaluative,0

"While sensible, this seems to me to be too minor a contribution to stand alone as a paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Additionally, I believe the experimental tasks are new, and as a result all implementations of competing techniques are by the paper authors. This makes it difficult to have confidence in the higher reported performance of the proposed techniques.",,arg_evaluative,0
This paper proposed a few-shot graph classification algorithm based on graph neural networks.,,arg_structuring,0
The learning is based on a large set of base class labeled graphs and a small set of novel class labeled graphs.,,arg_structuring,0
The goal is to learn a classification algorithm over the novel class based on the sample from the base class and novel class.,,arg_structuring,0
The learning process constitutes of the following steps.,,arg_structuring,0
"First, the base class is classified into K super classes based on the spectral embedding of the graph (onto distributions over the corresponding graph spectrum) and the k-means algorithm with the Wasserstein metric.",,arg_structuring,0
"Second, for each super class, the classification is done through a feature extractor and a classifier.",,arg_structuring,0
"In the training of the feature extractor and classifier, the author introduces a super-graph with each node representing a super class.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, in the fine-tuning stage, the feature extractor is fixed, and the classifier is trained based on the novel class.",,arg_structuring,0
This work seems to be the first attempt to adopt the few-shot learning in graph classification tasks.,,arg_structuring,0
"The architecture is novel, and the classification of graph based on spectral embedding together with the Wasserstein metric is novel to me.",,arg_evaluative,0
I vote for rejecting this submission for the following concerns.,,arg_structuring,0
1. The classification of base class into super classes seems questionable to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In the meta-learning language, the author attempts to learn a good representation of graphs based on different graph classification tasks generated by a task distribution.",,arg_structuring,0
"In terms of graph classification, the task distribution is supported on the joint distributions (G, Y).",,arg_structuring,0
"Hence, to characterize different tasks, as far as I am concerned, the classification should take both the graph G and the label Y into consideration, instead of solely the graph.",,arg_evaluative,0
"2. Though seemingly very important to the architecture, the purpose of constructing the super-graph g^{sup} in the training of C^{CAT} seems to be unclear to me.",,arg_evaluative,0

Slight improvements can also be seen on a simple maze navigation task as well as on a basic language modeling dataset.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall I like the motivation, provided background information and simplicity of the approach.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore, the cue-reward experiment seems to be a well designed show case for neuro-modulation.",,arg_evaluative,0

Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
"- evaluation: only on toy tasks (which includes PTB), no real world tasks",,arg_evaluative,0
- very incremental improvements on PTB over a very simple baseline (far from SotA),,arg_evaluative,0
- evaluated models (feed-forward NNs and LSTMs) are very basic and far from current SotA architectures,,arg_evaluative,0
- no qualitative analysis on how modulation is actually use by the systems.,,arg_evaluative,0
"E.g., when is modulation strong and when is it not used",,arg_fact,0
Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
"- perplexity improvements of less than 1.3 points over plasticity alone (which is the actual baseline for this paper) can hardy be called ""significant"". Even though they might be statistically significant (meaning nothing more than the two models being statistically different), minor architectural changes can lead to such improvements.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Furthermore PTB is not a ""challenging"" LM benchmark.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This paper proposes meta dropout, which leverages adaptive dropout training for regularizing gradient based meta learning models, e.g., MAML and MetaSGD.",,arg_structuring,0
Experiments on few shot learning show that meta dropout achieves better performance.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Overally, I think this paper is well motivated and experiments on few shot learning are impressive.",,arg_evaluative,0
I have only two major concerns.,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Sec 3.2. According to my understanding, Meta dropout introduces a learnable prior for latent $z$, but the training objective does not require posterior inference and thus no variational inference is needed.",,arg_fact,0
"I think it is ok to say that meta dropout tries to optimize a lower bound of log p(Y|X;\theta,\phi^*), but meta dropout does not regularize the variational framework because there is no variational inference framework.",,arg_request,1

Experiments on adversarial robustness can be further improved.,,arg_request,1
(1) the settings and the analysis of adversarial robustness experiment can be discussed in details.,,arg_request,1

"(3) FGSM is a quite weak adversarial attack method, which makes evaluating adversarial robustness on FGSM may be misleading.",,arg_evaluative,0

I am a making a recommendation for reject for this paper with the main reason being that I believe the primary derivations for their method appear flawed.,,arg_evaluative,0
"--In the main section describing the approach (Section 4), the authors start with a claim that Equation 1 and 2 are equal; I don’t believe 1 and 2 are equal.",,arg_evaluative,0

"--In the second line of Equation 5, the KL term appears to be measuring a distance between distributions on two different variables; z|c and c|z.",,arg_fact,0
If one were to interpret the second one as the unnormalized distribution on z defined via the likelihood for c given z; even this has an issue because then the expression for KL where we plug the unnormalized density in place of the normalized need not be positive which is something they need to derive their bound.,,arg_evaluative,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors present a empirical investigation of methods for scaling GANs to complex datasets, such as ImageNet, for class-conditioned image generation.",,arg_structuring,0
"They first build and describe a strong baseline based on recently proposed techniques for GANs and push the performance on large datasets with several modifications presented sequentially, to obtain strong state-of-the-art IS/FID scores, as well as impressive visual results.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors propose a simple truncation trick to control the fidelity/variance which is interesting on its own but cannot always scale with the architecture.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors further propose a orthogonalization-based regularization to mitigate this problem.,,arg_structuring,0
An investigation of training collapse at large scale is also performed; the authors investigate some regularization schemes based on gathered empirical evidence.,,arg_structuring,0
"As a result, they explore and discard Spectral Normalization of the generator as a way to prevent collapse and show that a severe tradeoff between stability and quality can be controlled when using zero-centered gradient penalties in the Discriminator.",,arg_structuring,0
"In the end, no solution that can ensure quality and stability is found, except having prohibitively large amounts of data (~300M images).",,arg_structuring,0
"Models are evaluated on the ImageNet and on this internal, bigger dataset.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
"- This investigation gives a significant amount of insights on GAN stability and performance at large scales, which should be useful for anyone working with GANs on complex datasets (and that have access to great computational resources).",,arg_evaluative,0
"- Even though commonly used evaluations metrics for GANs are still not fully adequate, the authors obtain quantitative performance significantly beyond previous work, which seems indeed correlated with remarkable visual results.",,arg_evaluative,0
- The baseline and added modifications are well presented and clearly explained.,,arg_evaluative,0
The Appendices also have great value in that regard.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
- Discussions sometimes lack depth or are absent.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, it is unclear to me why some larger models are not amenable to truncation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides visible artifacts, what does it mean? Why does a smoother G reduces those artifacts?",,arg_request,1
Were samples from those networks better without using truncation? Why would this be?,,none,0
"Authors report how wider networks perform best, and how deeper networks degrade performance.",,arg_fact,0
"Again, discussions are lacking, and it doesn’t seem the authors tried to understand why such behaviors were shown.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Even though this is mostly an empirical investigation, I think some more efforts should be put in understanding and explaining why some of those behaviors are shown, as I think it can bootstrap future work more easily.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- In Section 3.1 : “Across runs in Table 1, we observe that without Orthogonal Regularization, only 16% of models are amenable to truncation compared to 60% with Orthogonal Regularization.” For me, this is not particularly clear.",,arg_evaluative,0
Is this something the reader should understand from Table 1?,,none,0
- I question the choice of sections chosen to be in the main paper/appendices.,,arg_evaluative,0
I greatly appreciated the negative results reported in the main text as well as in the appendices and this has significant value.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, as this is to me mostly a detailed empirical investigation and presentation of high-performance GANs on large scales, I would be likely to share this with colleagues who want to tackle similar problems.",,arg_fact,0
"In this case, if future readers limit themselves to the main text, I think it can have more value to present some content form Appendix B and C than to have more than a full page on stability investigations and attempted tricks that turned out not to be used to reach maximal performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However I do not want to discourage publishing of negative results, and I definitely wish to see this investigation in the paper, but I merely question the positioning of such information.",,arg_fact,0
"With regard to my first negative point above about the lack of discussions, it seems the analysis of Section 4 is disproportionate compared to other places.",,arg_evaluative,0
Suggestions/Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
"- Regarding the diversity/fidelity tradeoff using different truncation thresholds, I think constraining the norm of the sampled noise vectors to the exact threshold value (by projecting the samples on the 0-centered hyper-sphere of radius = threshold) could yield even more interesting or more informative Figures, as obtained scores or samples on the edge of that hyper-sphere might provide information on the ‘guaranteed’ (not proven) quality/fidelity of samples mapped from inside that hyper-sphere.",,arg_fact,0
"- In Appendix D, the Figures could be slightly clarified by using a colored heatmap to color the curve, with colors corresponding to the threshold values.",,arg_evaluative,0
Similar curves could also be produced with the hyper-sphere projection proposed above to have a slightly clearer idea of the behavior on the limit of that hyper-sphere.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- In Section 4.2, in the second paragraph, you refer to Appendix F and describe “sharp upward jump at collapse” in D’s loss.",,arg_fact,0
"However, it seems the only Figure showing D’s loss when unconstrained is Figure 26, in which it is hard to notice any significant jump in the loss.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- In Appendix F, Figure 20 d), the title seems wrong. It seems to report sigma^2 values, but the title says “losses”.",,arg_evaluative,0
This investigation of GAN scalability is successful results-wise even though the inability to stabilize training without sacrificing great performance on ImageNet is disappointing.,,arg_evaluative,0
The improvement over previous SOTA is definitely significant.,,arg_fact,0
This work thus shows a modern GAN architecture for complex datasets that could be a strong basis for future work.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, I think the paper could and should be improved with some more detailed analysis and discussions of exhibited behaviors in order to further guide and encourage future work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It could also be clarified on some aspects, and potentially re-structured a bit to be better align with its probable impact directions.",,arg_evaluative,0
I would also be curious to see the proposed techniques applied on simpler datasets.,,arg_evaluative,0
Can this be useful for someone having less compute power and working on something similar to CelebA?,,arg_request,1
This paper proposed a framework to incorporate GAN into MAP inference process for general image restoration.,,arg_structuring,0
"First, the motivation of the proposed framework is not convincing for me.",,arg_evaluative,0
"That is, authors assumed that they have a degradation function F and all the inference process is just based on this known function.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, in real world scenarios, it is actually challenging to obtain exact degradation information.",,arg_evaluative,0
Thus we may only apply the proposed model on a few tasks with exactly known F.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Second, due to the norm based constraints, authors actually need to optimize a highly nonconvex optimization problem.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Moreover, due to the trace based loss function, the computational cost will also be very high.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Please notice that standard MAP based methods only need to solve a simple convex optimization model (e.g., TV) and these methods can also be applied for different restoration tasks.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Actually, we only need to specify particular fidelity terms for different tasks.",,arg_fact,0
"Moreover, very recent works have also successfully incorporate both generative and discriminative network architectures (e.g., [1,2]) into the optimization process.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore, I cannot find any advantage in the proposed method, compared with these existing MAP based image restoration approaches.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Finally, the experimental part is also too weak to evaluate the proposed method.",,arg_evaluative,0
"As I have mentioned above, actually a lot of methods have been developed to address general image restoration tasks.",,arg_evaluative,0
Some works actually also incorporate generative and/or discriminative networks into MAP inference process for these tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0
Thus I believe authors must compare their method with these state-of-the-art approaches.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Moreover, authors should conduct experiments on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including natural images.",,arg_request,1
"This is because the digitals images in MNIST do not have rich texture and detail structures, thus are not very challenging for standard image restoration methods.",,arg_request,1

Description,,arg_structuring,0
The work is motivated by the empirical performance of Batch Normalization and in particular the observed better robustness of the choice of the learning rate.,,arg_structuring,0
"Authors analyze theoretically the asymptotic convergence rate for objectives involving normalization, not necessarily BN, and show that for scale-invariant groups of parameters (appearing as a result of normalization) the initial learning rate may be set arbitrary while still asymptotic convergence is guaranteed with the same rate as the best known in the general case.",,arg_structuring,0
Offline gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent cases are considered.,,arg_structuring,0
* Strengths,,arg_structuring,0
"The work addresses better theoretical understanding of successful heuristics in deep learning, namely batch normalization and other normalizations.",,arg_evaluative,0
The technical results obtained are non-trivial and detailed proofs are presented.,,arg_evaluative,0
Also I did not verify the proofs the paper appears technically correct and technically clear.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The result may be interpreted in the following form: if one chooses to use BN or other normalization, the paper gives a recommendation that only the learning rate of scale-variant parameters need to be set, which may have some practical advantages.",,arg_fact,0
"Perhaps more important than the rate of convergence, is the guarantee that the method will not diverge (and will not get stuck in a non-local minimum).",,arg_fact,0
* Criticism,,arg_structuring,0
This paper presents non-trivial theoretical results that are worth to be published but as I argue below its has a weak relevance to practice and the applicability of the obtained results is unclear.,,arg_evaluative,0
-- Concerns regarding the clarity of presentation and interpretation of the results.,,arg_structuring,0
"The properties of BN used as motivation for the study, are observed non-asymptotically with constant or empirically decreased learning rate schedules for a limited number of iterations.",,arg_fact,0
"In contrast, the studied learning rates are asymptotic and there is a big discrepancy.",,arg_evaluative,0
"SGD is observed to be significantly faster than batch gradient when far from convergence (experimental evidence), and",,arg_fact,0
this is with or without normalization.,,none,0
"In practice, the training is stopped much before convergence, in the hope of finding solutions close to minimum with high probability.",,arg_fact,0
There is in fact no experimental evidence that the practical advantages of BN are relevant to the results proven.,,arg_evaluative,0
"It makes a nice story that the theoretical properties justify the observations, but they may be as well completely unrelated.",,arg_evaluative,0
"As seen from the formal construction, the theoretical results apply equally well to all normalization methods.",,arg_fact,0
It occludes the clarity that BN is emphasized amongst them.,,arg_fact,0
"Considering theoretically, what advantages truly follow from the paper for optimizing a given function? Let’s consider the following cases.",,arg_request,1
1. For optimizing a general smooth function with all parameters forming a single scale-invariant vector.,,none,0
"In this case, the paper proves that no careful selection of the learning rate is necessary.",,arg_evaluative,0
This result is beyond machine learning and unfortunately I cannot evaluate its merit.,,arg_social,0
Is it known / not known in optimization?,,arg_request,1
2. The case of data-independent normalization (such as weight normalization).,,arg_structuring,0
"Without normalization, we have to tune learning rate to achieve the optimal convergence.",,arg_fact,0
"With normalization we still have to tune the learning rate (as scale-variant parameters remain or are reintroduced with each invariance to preserve the degrees of freedom), then we have to wait for the phase two of Lemma 3.2 so that the learning rate of scale-invariant parameters adapts, and from then on the optimal convergence rate can be guaranteed.",,arg_fact,0
3. The case of Batch Normalization.,,arg_structuring,0
Note that there is no direct correspondence between the loss of BN-normalized network (2) and the loss of the original network because of dependence of the normalization on the batches.,,arg_fact,0
"In other words, there is no setting of parameters of the original network that would make its forward pass equivalent to that of BN network (2) for all batches.",,arg_fact,0
The theory tells the same as in case 2 above but with an additional price of optimizing a different function.,,arg_evaluative,0
These points remain me puzzled regarding either practical or theoretical application of the result. It would be great if authors could elaborate.,,arg_evaluative,0
-- Difference from Wu et al. 2018,,arg_structuring,0
This works is cited as a source of inspiration in several places in the paper.,,arg_fact,0
"As the submission is a theoretical result with no immediate applicability, it would be very helpful if the authors could detail the technical improvements over this related work.",,arg_request,1
"Note, ICLR policy says that arxiv preprints earlier than one month before submission are considered a prior art. Could the authors elaborate more on possible practical/theoretical applications?",,arg_request,1
* Side Notes (not affecting the review recommendation),,arg_structuring,0
I believe that the claim that “BN reduces covariate shift” (actively discussed in the intro) was an imprecise statement in the original work.,,arg_fact,0
"Instead, BN should be able to quickly adapt to the covariate shift when it occurs.",,arg_fact,0
"It achieves this by using the parameterization in which the mean and variance statistics of neurons (the quantities whose change is called the covariate shift) depend on variables that are local to the layer (gamma, beta in (1)) rather than on the cumulative effect of all of the preceding layers.",,arg_fact,0
* Revision,,arg_structuring,0
I took into account the discussion and the newly added experiments and increased the score.,,arg_social,0
The experiments verify the proven effect and make the paper more substantial.,,arg_evaluative,0
Some additional comments about experiments follow.,,arg_structuring,0
Training loss plots would be more clear in the log scale.,,arg_request,1
"Comparison to ""SGD BN removed"" is not fair because the initialization is different (application of BN re-initializes weight scales and biases).",,arg_evaluative,0
"The same initialization can be achieved by performing one training pass with BN with 0 learning rate and then removing it, see e.g. Gitman, I. and Ginsburg, B. (2017).",,none,0
Comparison of batch normalization and weight normalization algorithms for the large-scale image classification.,,arg_request,1
The use of Glorot uniform initializer is somewhat subtle.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Since BN is used, Glorot initialization has no effect for a forward pass.",,none,0
"However, it affects the gradient norm.",,none,0
"Is there a rationale in this setting or it is just a more tricky method to fix the weight norm to some constant, e.g. ||w||=1?",,arg_request,1
"In this paper, the authors propose a method for dimensionality reduction of image data.",,arg_structuring,0
They provide a structured and deterministic function G that maps a set of parameters C to an image X = G(C).,,arg_structuring,0
"The number of parameters C is smaller than the number of free parameters in the image X, so this results in a predictive model that can be used for compression, denoising, inpainting, superresolution and other inverse problems.",,arg_structuring,0
"The structure of G is as follows: starting with a small fixed, multichannel white noise image, linearly mix the channels, truncate the negative values to zero and upsample.",,arg_structuring,0
This process is repeated multiple times and finally the output is squashed through a sigmoid function for the output to remain in the 0..1 range.,,arg_structuring,0
"This approach makes sense and the model is indeed more principled than the one taken by Ulyanov et al. In fact, the DIP of Ulyanov et al. can hardly be considered ""a model"" (or a prior, for that matter), and instead should be considered ""an algorithm"", since it relies on the early stopping of a specific optimization algorithm.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This means that we are not interested in the minimum of the cost function associated to the model, which contradicts the very concept of ""cost function"".",,arg_evaluative,0
"If only global optimizers were available, DIP wouldn't work, showing its value is in the interplay of the ""cost"" function and a specific optimization algorithm.",,arg_fact,0
None of these problems exist with the presented approach.,,arg_evaluative,0
The exposition is clear and the presented inverse problems as well as demonstrated performance are sufficient.,,arg_evaluative,0
One thing that I missed while reading the paper is more comment on negative results.,,arg_request,1
"Did the authors tried any version of their model with convolutions or pooling and found it not to perform as well? Measuring the number of parameters when including pooling or convolutions can become tricky, was that part of the reason?",,arg_request,1

"In this paper ""large compression ratios"" means little compression, which I found confusing.",,arg_request,1
The recent work of Schott et al (which the authors compare results to) proposed the use of Bayes rule inversion as a more robust mechanism for classification under different types of adversarial attacks.,,arg_structuring,0
The probabilities are approximated with variational autoencoders.,,arg_structuring,0
"During training the inference network is used, but during testing optimization based inference is carried out to compute loglikelihoods.",,arg_structuring,0
"This paper focuses on the second part, with a different model.",,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, it proposes a specific Boltzmann machine to be used as a first layer of neural networks for MNIST classification.",,arg_structuring,0
This Boltzmann machine is pre-trained in two-stages using mean field inference of the binary latent variables and gradient estimation of the parameters.,,arg_structuring,0
This pre-trained model is then incorporated into the neural net for MNIST classification.,,arg_structuring,0
The existence of couplings J_h among the hidden units means that we have to carry out mean field inference over several iterations to compute the output activations of the model.,,arg_structuring,0
"This is basically analogous to the optimization-based inference proposed by Schott et al. (As a detail, this optimization can be expressed as computation over several layers of a neural net.)",,arg_structuring,0
The authors compare to the work of Schott for one type of attack.,,arg_structuring,0
It would be nice to see more detailed experiments as done in Schott.,,arg_request,1
Questions:,,arg_structuring,0
1- Why not use a single Boltzmann machine with 128 fully connected latent variables? Could you add this experiment please.,,arg_request,1
2- Why is a two-stage pre-training (Figure 2) process needed? Why not just a single stage?,,arg_request,1
3- Is the key that you used only 679 patches containing 98% of occurrences in the dataset as the first stage? What if we vary this percentage? How sensitive are the results? Such experiments could be useful to understand better why your method appears to work well.,,arg_request,1
4- Could you please add the found J_h's to the appendix.,,arg_request,1
This architecture reminds me of the good old MRFs for image denoising.,,arg_other,0
Could it be that what we are seeing is the attack being denoised?,,arg_request,1
"I am puzzled and looking forward to answers to the above questions. I don't yet understand what is the thing that makes this approach appear to work, or why you were able to drop the Bayes inference inversion altogether as done by Schott.",,arg_request,1

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"This paper makes an observation that most of the neural network architectures do not learn the mutual exclusivity (ME) bias: if an object has one label, then it does not need another.",,arg_structuring,0
Authors demonstrate this in both synthetic tasks and real-world tasks like object recognition and machine translation.,,arg_structuring,0
Authors argue that ME bias could help the model to handle new classes and rare events better.,,arg_structuring,0
My comments:,,arg_structuring,0
I very much enjoyed reading this paper.,,arg_social,0
I support accepting this paper.,,arg_social,0
It highlights one of the missing inductive biases in ML and proposes it as a challenge.,,arg_evaluative,0
"As the authors also agree, ME bias is missing not just in DNNs.",,arg_fact,0
It is the issue of MLE.,,arg_fact,0
It would be good to have some non-NN results too.,,arg_evaluative,0
I see this is a challenge for MLE than DNNs.,,arg_fact,0

=====================================================,,arg_structuring,0
After rebuttal: I have read the authors' response and  I stand by my decision.,,arg_social,0
i have change my rating from 5 to 6 after reading the numerous and thorough rebuttals from the authors.,,arg_social,0
I hope they will incorporate these clarifications and additional experiments into the final version of the paper if accepted.,,arg_social,0
The purpose of this paper is presumably to approximate the margin of a sample as accurately as possible.,,arg_structuring,0
This is clearly an intractable problem.,,arg_structuring,0
"Thus all attacks make some kind of approximation, including this paper.",,arg_structuring,0
"I am still a bit confused about the difference between ""zero-confidence attacks"" and those that don't fall into that category such as PGD.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Since all of these are approximations, and we cannot know how far we are from the true margin, I don't see why these categories help.",,arg_evaluative,0
The authors spend two paragraphs in the introduction trying to draw a distinction but I am still not convinced.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The proofs provided by the authors assume that convexity and many assumptions, which makes it not very useful for the real world case.",,arg_evaluative,0
"What would have been helpful is to show the accuracy of their margin for simple binary toy 2D problems, where the true margin and their approximation can be visualized.",,arg_request,1
This was not done.,,arg_evaluative,0
This reduces the paper to an empirical exercise rather than a true understanding of their method's advantages and limitations.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Finally, the experimental results do not show any significant advantage over PGD, either in running time (they are slower) or norm perturbation.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Thus their novelty rests on the definition of zero confidence attack, and of the importance of such a attack.",,arg_fact,0
So clarifying the above question will help to judge the paper's novelty.,,arg_request,1
The authors proposed meta domain adaptation to address domain shift scenario in meta learning setup.,,arg_structuring,0
The proposed model combines few shot meta-learning with the adversarial domain adaptation to demonstrate performance improvements in several experiments.,,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
1. A new few shot learning with domain shift problem is studied in the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
2. A new model combining prototypical network with GAN and cycle-consistency loss for addressing meta-learning domain shift scenario.,,arg_evaluative,0
The experimental improvements on omniglot seem quite substantial.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
1. Can you clarify why the proposed approach is better than the Meta-RevGrad baseline?,,arg_request,1
It seems that both are using meta-learning with domain adaptation technique.,,arg_fact,0
What happen for Meta-RevGrad + idt or Meta-RevGrad + revMap?,,arg_request,1
I feel the baseline in domain adaptation area is a bit limited.,,arg_evaluative,0
"2. How is the performance of a simpler baseline such as combining a subset of new domain as training set to train MAML or PN (probably in 5-shot, 5-class case)?",,arg_request,1
3. It seems the domain shift in the paper is less dramatic.,,arg_fact,0
"i.e., omniglot <-> omniglot-M. I wonder whether the proposed approach can still work in large domain shift such as omniglot to fashion-mnist etc.",,arg_request,1
4. The novelty of the model is relatively limited as it is a combination of previous techniques on a new problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
Minor:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Where is L_da in Figure 2? In Figure 2, what’s the unlabelled data from which testing tasks are drawn? Is it from meta-test data training set?",,arg_request,1

"1. The paper should also talk about the details of ARNet and discuss the difference, as I assume they are the most related work",,arg_request,1
"2. during sampling, either training or testing, how do authors handle temporal overlap or make it overlap?",,arg_request,1
"3. can you provide the training memory, inference speed, and total training time?",,arg_request,1
"4. Most importantly, for table4, authors are comparing to the ResNet18 ARNet instead of ResNet50? which is better than the proposed method.",,arg_evaluative,0

"This paper proposes a distributed backdoor attack strategy, framed differently from the previous two main approches (1) the centralised backdoor approach and (2) the (less discussed in the paper) distributed fault tolerance approach (often named ""Byzantine"").",,arg_structuring,0
The authors show through experiments how their attack is more persistent than centralised backdoor attack.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors also compare two aggregation rules for federated learning schemes, (Fung et al 2018 & Pillutla et al 2019), suggesting that both rules are bypassed by the proposed distributed backdoor attack.",,arg_structuring,0
Strength:,,arg_structuring,0
"what I found most interesting in the paper is Section 3.4, presenting an appreciable attempt to ""interpret"" poisoning. Together with Section 4.",,arg_evaluative,0
This kind of fine-grained analysis of poisoning is highly needed.,,arg_evaluative,0
Weakness:,,arg_structuring,0
"in section 3.3, the authors compare against RFA and take what is claimed in Pillulata et al as granted (that RFA detects more nuanced outliers than the wort-case of the Byzantine setting",,arg_fact,0
(Blanchard et al 2017) ),,arg_other,0

"In fact, there is more to the Byzantine setting than that,",,arg_evaluative,0
"see e.g. Draco (Chen et al 2018 SysML), Bulyan (El Mhamdi et al 2018 ICML) and SignSGD (Bernstein et al 2019 ICLR) which have proposed more sophisticated approches to distributed robustness.",,none,0
"Since this paper is about distributed robustness and distributed attacks, it would be very informative to the community to illustrate DBA attack on these methods to have a more compelling message.",,arg_request,1

This paper develops a framework for evaluating the ability of neural models on answering free-form mathematical problems.,,arg_structuring,0
"The contributions are i) a publicly available dataset, and ii) an evaluation of two existing model families, recurrent networks and the Transformer.",,arg_structuring,0
I think that this paper makes a good contribution by establishing a benchmark and providing some preliminary results.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I am biased because I once did exactly the same thing as this paper, although at a much smaller scale; I am thus happy to see such a public dataset.",,arg_social,0
The paper is a reasonable dataset/analysis paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
Whether to accept it or not depends on what standard ICLR has towards such papers (ones that do not propose a new model/new theory).,,arg_fact,0
I think that the dataset generation process is well-thought-out.,,arg_evaluative,0
"There are a large variety of modules, and trying to not generate either trivial or impossible problems is a plus in my opinion.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The results and discussions in the main part of the paper are too light in my opinion; the average model accuracy across modules is not an interesting metric at all, although it does show that the Transformer performs better than recurrent networks.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I think the authors should move a portion of the big bar plot (too low resolution, btw) into the main text and discuss it thoroughly.",,arg_request,1
"Details on how to generate the dataset, however, can be moved into the appendix.",,arg_request,1
"I am also not entirely satisfied by using accuracy as the only metric; how about using something like beam search to build a ""soft"", secondary metric?",,arg_request,1
One other thing I want to see is a test set with multiple different difficulty levels.,,arg_request,1
"The authors try to do this with composition, which is good, but I am not sure whether that captures the real important thing - the ability to generalize, say learning to factorise single-variable polynomials and test it on factorising polynomials with multiple variables? And what about the transfer between these tasks (e.g., if a network learns to solve equations with both x and y and also factorise a polynomial with x, can it generalize to the unseen case of factorising a polynomial with both x and y)?",,arg_request,1
"Also, is there an option for ""unsolvable""?",,arg_request,1
"For example, the answer being a special ""this is impossible"" character for ""factorise x^2 - 5"" (if your training set does not use \sqrt, of course).",,arg_fact,0
"In this work the authors propose an extension of mixture density networks to the continuous domain, named compound density networks.",,arg_structuring,0
Specifically the paper builds on top of the idea of the ensemble neural networks (NNs) and introduces a stochastic neural network for handling the mixing components.,,arg_structuring,0
The mixing distribution is also parameterised by a neural network.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors claim that the proposed model can result in better uncertainty estimates and the experiments attempt to demonstrate the benefits of the approach, especially in cases of having to deal with adversarial attacks.",,arg_structuring,0
The paper in general is well written and easy to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
I have some concerns regarding the presentation of the main objective and the lack of justification in certain parts of the methodology.,,arg_evaluative,0
Let me elaborate.,,arg_other,0
"First of all, I don’t understand how the main equation of the compound density network in Equation (3) is different from the general case of a Bayesian neural network? Can the authors please comment on that?",,arg_request,1
I also find weird the way that the authors arrive to their final objective in Equation (5).,,arg_evaluative,0
They start from Equation (4) which is incorrectly denoted as the log-marginal distribution while it is the same conditional distribution introduced in Equation (3) with the extra summation for all the available data points.,,arg_evaluative,0
Then they continue to Equation (5) which they present as the combination of the true likelihood with a KL regularisation term.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, what the authors implicitly did was to perform variational inference for maximising their likelihood by introducing a variational distribution q(\theta) = p(\theta | g(x_n; \psi).",,arg_evaluative,0
Is there a reason why the authors do not introduce their objective by following the variational framework?,,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, in the beginning of Section 3.1 the authors present their idea on probabilistic hypernetoworks which “maps x to a distribution over parameters instead of specific value \theta.” How is this different from the case that we were considering so far? If we had a point estimate for \theta we would not require to take an expectation in Equation (3) in the first place.",,arg_evaluative,0
"My biggest concern in the methodology, however, has to do with the selection of the matrix variate normal prior for the weights and the imposition of diagonal covariances (diag(a) and diag(b)).",,arg_evaluative,0
"The Kronecker product between two diagonal matrices results in another diagonal matrix, i.e., diagonal covariance, which implies that the weights within a layer are given by an independent multivariate Gaussian.",,arg_fact,0
What is the purpose then for introducing the matrix variate Gaussian?,,arg_request,1
I would expect that you would like to impose additional structure to the weights.,,arg_other,0
I expect the authors to comment on that.,,arg_request,1
Regarding the experimental evaluation of the model rather confusing.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors have proposed a model that due to the mixing is better suited for predictions with heteroscedastic noise and can better quantify the aleatoric uncertainty.,,arg_fact,0
"However, the selected experiments on the cubic regression toy data (Section 5.1) and the out-of-distribution classification (Section 5.2) are clear examples of system’s noise, i.e. epistemic uncertainty.",,arg_evaluative,0
The generative process of the toy data clearly states that there is no heteroscedastic noise to handle.,,arg_fact,0
"The same applies for the notMNIST data which belong to a completely different data set compared to MNIST and thus out of sample prediction cannot benefit from the mixing; i.e., variations have to be explained by system’s noise.",,arg_fact,0
So overall I have the feeling that the authors have not succeeded to evaluate the model’s power with these two experiments and we cannot draw any strong conclusions regarding the benefit of the proposed mixing approach.,,arg_evaluative,0
"To continue with the experimental evaluation, I found the plots with the predictive uncertainty in Figure 3 a bit confusing.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The plot by itself, as I understood, quantifies the model’s uncertainty in in- and out-of sample prediction.",,arg_fact,0
"While I agree with the authors that it is generally desirable for a model to be more confident when predicting in MNIST (since it has already seen samples of it) compared to when predicting in notMNIST (completely different data), these plots tells us nothing regarding the predictive power of the model.",,arg_evaluative,0
"There is no value in being very confident if you are wrong and vice-versa, so unless there is an accompanying plot/table reporting the accuracy I see not much value from this plot alone.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Finally, it is unclear how the authors have picked the best \lambda parameter for their approach? On page 5 they state that they “pick the value that results in a good trade-off between high uncertainty estimates and high prediction accuracy.” Does this mean that you get to observe the performance in the test in order to select the appropriate value for \lambda? If this is the case this is completely undesirable and is considered a bad practice.",,arg_request,1
Paper summary.,,arg_structuring,0
"The paper proposes Dreamer, a model-based RL method for high-dimensional inputs such as images.",,arg_structuring,0
The main novelty in Dreamer is to learn a policy function from latent representation-and-transition models in an end-to-end manner.,,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, Dreamer is an actor-critic method that learns an optimal policy by backpropagating re-parameterized gradients through a value function, a latent transition model, and a latent representation model.",,arg_structuring,0
This is unlike existing methods which use model-free or planning methods on simulated trajectories to learn the optimal policy.,,arg_structuring,0
"Meanwhile, Dreamer learns the remaining components, namely a value function, a latent transition model, and a latent representation model, based on existing methods (the world models and PlaNet).",,arg_structuring,0
Experiments on a large set of continuous control tasks show that Dreamer outperforms existing model-based and model-free methods.,,arg_structuring,0
Comments.,,arg_structuring,0
Efficiently learning a policy from visual inputs is an important research direction in RL.,,arg_fact,0
This paper takes a step in this direction by improving existing model-based methods (the world models and PlaNet) using the actor-critic approach.,,arg_evaluative,0
I am leaning towards weak accepting the paper.,,arg_social,0
I am reluctant to give a higher score due to its incremental contribution.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Specifically, the policy update in Dreamer resembles that of SVG (Heess et al., 2015), which also backpropagates re-parameterized gradients through a value function and a transition model.",,arg_evaluative,0
The main difference between Dreamer and SVG is that Dreamer incorporates a latent representation model.,,arg_structuring,0
"From this viewpoint, the actor-critic component in Dreamer is an incremental contribution.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Since the latent models are learned based on existing techniques, the paper presents an incremental contribution.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides the above comments, I have these additional comments.",,arg_structuring,0
- Effectiveness on very long horizon trajectories:,,arg_structuring,0
Simulating long-horizon trajectories with a probabilistic model is known to be unsuitable for model-based RL due to accumulated errors.,,arg_fact,0
This is an open issue in model-based RL.,,arg_fact,0
"The paper attempts to solve this issue by backpropagating policy gradients through the transition model, which is known to be more robust against model errors (see e.g., PILCO (Deisenroth et al., 2011)).",,arg_structuring,0
"However, the issue still exists in Dreamer, since there seems to be an upper limit of effective horizon length (perhaps around 40, according to Figure 4).",,arg_evaluative,0
"This horizon length is still short compared to the entire horizon length of many MDPs (e.g., 1000).",,arg_fact,0
I think this point should be discussed in the paper.,,arg_request,1
"That is, the issue still exists, and Dreamer is less effective with very long horizon.",,arg_evaluative,0
- Inapplicability to discrete controls:,,arg_structuring,0
One restriction of re-parameterized gradients is that the technique is not applicable to discrete random variables.,,arg_fact,0
"This restriction exists in Dreamer, and the method cannot be applied to discrete control tasks unless approximation techniques such as Gumbel-softmax are used.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Still, such approximations would make learning more challenging, especially with long-horizon backpropagation.",,arg_fact,0
This restriction should be noted in the paper.,,arg_request,1
- There is no mention about variance of policy gradient estimates.,,arg_structuring,0
"Dreamer does not use any variance reduction technique, so the gradient estimates could have very large variance.",,arg_evaluative,0
- q_theta was introduced in Eq. (8) before it is defined in Eq. (11).,,arg_evaluative,0
"Also, I suggest moving Section 4 to be right after Section 2, since Section 4 presents existing techniques similarly to Section 2, while Section 3 presents the main contribution.",,arg_request,1
Update after authors' response.,,arg_structuring,0
I read the response.,,arg_social,0
The paper is more clear after authors' clarification.,,arg_social,0
"Though, I still think the contribution is incremental, since back-propagating gradients through values and dynamics has been studied in prior works (albeit with less empirical successes compared to Dreamer).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Nonetheless, I am keen to acceptance. I would increase the rating from 6 to 7, but I will keep the rating of 6 since the rating of 7 is not possible.",,arg_social,0
"This is an novel, interesting paper on an important topic: semi-supervised learning.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Even though the proposed approach seems to have significant potential, the experimental",,arg_evaluative,0
"is somewhat disorganized,",,none,0
and it also includes some weak claims that should be removed.,,arg_request,1
"For example, the number of labeled examples in Table 1 is fairly large and inconsistent (4K, 1K, 10K for the 3 organic datasets).",,arg_request,1
"In this reviewer's opinion, it would be a lot more reasonable to have instead a learning curve showing the results for, say, 100, 500, 1K, 5K, and 10K labeled examples for all three domains.",,arg_request,1
"In 4.1, you are using different epsilon policies for synthetic vs organic datasets; why?",,arg_request,1
"The explanation for underperforming on SVHM (page 7) may be valid, but you could easily prove it right or wrong by adding an option to SST for ""stratified SSL."" Without this extra work, your claim is just a conjecture.",,arg_request,1
You should also show the performance of regular SSL methods in the setup on Table 4.,,arg_request,1
"Last but not least, you have repeatedly made the claim combining SST and other SSL may further improve the performance;",,arg_fact,0
"however, you do not provide any evidence for it, so you should avoid making such claims.",,arg_request,1
Other comments:,,arg_structuring,0
"- on page 2, the two terms classification & selection network appear ""out of the blue;"" it would be quite helpful to make it clear from the abstract that the proposed implementation is for neural networks.",,arg_request,1
- figures 2 & 3 should be a lot larger in order to be readable,,arg_request,1
"- 4.1.2 top of page 7: claims such as ""SST could have obtained better performance"" have no place in such a paper; you could instead make a note about the method being ""prohibitively CPU intensive for the time being""",,arg_request,1
"- lower on the same page you say: ""SST may get better performance"" - see above",,arg_request,1
Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper addresses the computational aspects of Viterbi-based encoding for neural networks.,,arg_structuring,0
"In usual Viterbi codes, input messages are encoded via a convolution with a codeword, and then decoded using a trellis.",,arg_structuring,0
"Now consider a codebook with n convolutional codes, of rate 1/k.",,arg_structuring,0
Then a vector of length n is represented by inputing a message of length k and receiving n encoded bits.,,arg_structuring,0
Then the memory footprint (in terms of messages) is reduced by rate k/n.,,arg_structuring,0
"This is the format that will be used to encode the row indices in a matrix, with n columns.",,arg_structuring,0
(The value of each nonzero is stored separately.),,arg_structuring,0
"However, it is clear that not all messages are possible, only those in the ""range space"" of my codes. (This part is previous work Lee 2018.)",,arg_structuring,0
"The ""Double Viterbi"" (new contribution) refers to the storage of the nonzero values themselves.",,arg_structuring,0
"A weakness of CSR and CSC (carried over to the previous work) is that since each row may have a different number of nonzeros, then finding the value of any particular nonzero requires going through the list to find the right corresponding nonzero, a sequential task.",,arg_structuring,0
"Instead, m new Viterbi decompressers are included, where each row becomes (s_1*codeword_1 + s_2*codeword2 + ...) cdot mask, and the new scalar are the results of the linear combinations of the codewords.",,arg_structuring,0
Pros:,,arg_structuring,0
"- I think the work addressed here is important, and though the details are hard to parse and the new contributions seemingly small, it is important enough for practical performance.",,arg_evaluative,0
- The idea is theoretically sound and interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
Cons:,,arg_structuring,0
- My biggest issue is that there is no clear evaluation of the runtime benefit of the second Viterbi decompressor.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Compressability is evaluated, but that was already present in the previous work.",,arg_evaluative,0
Therefore the novel contribution of this paper over Lee 2018 is not clearly outlined.,,arg_evaluative,0
- It is extremely hard to follow what exactly is going on; I believe a few illustrative examples would help make the paper much clearer; in fact the idea is not that abstract.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- Minor grammatical mistakes (missing ""a"" or ""the"" in front of some terms, suggest proofread.)",,arg_request,1
The paper considers the problem of dictionary learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"Here the model that we are given samples y, where we know that y = Ax where A is a dictionary matrix, and x is a random sparse vector.",,arg_structuring,0
"The goal is typically to recover the dictionary A, from which one can also recover the x under suitable conditions on A. The paper shows that there is an alternating optimization-based algorithm for this problem that under standard assumptions provably converges exactly to the true dictionary and the true coefficients x (up to some negligible bias).",,arg_structuring,0
The main comparison with prior work,,arg_structuring,0
is with [1].,,arg_structuring,0
"Both give algorithms of this type for the same problem, with similar assumptions (although there is some difference; see below).",,arg_structuring,0
"In [1], the authors give two algorithms: one with a better sample complexity than the algorithm presented here, but which has some systematic, somewhat large, error floor which it cannot exceed, and another which can obtain similar rates of convergence to the exact solution, but which requires polynomial sample complexity (the explicit bound is not stated in the paper).",,arg_structuring,0
The algorithm here seems to build off of the former algorithm; essentially replacing a single hard thresholding step with an IHT-like step.,,arg_structuring,0
This update rule is able to remove the error floor and achieve exact recovery.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, this makes the analysis substantially more difficult.",,arg_structuring,0
"I am not an expert in this area, but this seems like a nice and non-trivial result.",,arg_evaluative,0
The proofs are quite dense and I was unable to verify them carefully.,,arg_evaluative,0
Comments:,,arg_structuring,0

This paper studies the generalization properties of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and its variants for the sequence to sequence multiclass prediction problem.,,arg_structuring,0
The problem is important to understand in the theoretical machine learning community.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper is written well overall, clearly explaining the results obtained.",,arg_evaluative,0
I would like to raise several important points:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. Missing comparison with parameter counting bounds: there has been a long line of research on generalization bounds for RNNs by obtaining bounds on the VC dimension of the function class [1, 2] which provide generalization bounds for various non-linearities.",,arg_evaluative,0
The bounds obtained are polynomial in the sequence length T (often sublinear or linear) and should be compared with the existing bounds for a thorough comparison.,,arg_request,1
2. Vacuous bounds in the regime \beta >1: Most recurrent architectures with no restrictions on the transition matrices work in the regime where they are more expressive and \beta >1.,,arg_fact,0
A quick glance at Table 1 suggests that the bounds obtained through Theorem 3 are exponential in t and are mostly vacuous.,,arg_evaluative,0
They can indeed be subsumed by generalization bounds based on VC theory.,,arg_evaluative,0
The bound obtained in Theorem 2 comes rather easily from the bounded assumption on the non-linearity and is this not very interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
"3. Technical contribution: While the authors propose the first bounds for LSTMs and MGUs, most of the analysis seems to be a marginal contribution over the work of Bartlett et al. [3]",,arg_evaluative,0
"4. Missing experiments to validate nature of bounds: Bartlett et al. [3] performed extensive experiments to exhibit the correct scaling of the generalization bounds with the ""model complexity"" introduced upto numerical constants.",,arg_evaluative,0

adaptive versions of sgd are commonly used in machine learning.,,arg_fact,0
"adagrad, adadelta are both popular adaptive variations of sgd.",,arg_fact,0
These algorithms can be seen as preconditioned versions of gradient descent where the preconditioner applied is a matrix of second-order moments of the gradients.,,arg_fact,0
"However, because this matrix turns out to be a pxp matrix where p is the number of parameters in the model, maintaining and performing linear algebra with this pxp matrix is computationally intensive.",,arg_fact,0

The study is motivated by the observation that the Q-value matrix in reinforcement learning problems often has a low-rank structure.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper proposes an approach called structured value-based planning or learning, where the Q matrix or the Q function is estimated from incomplete observations based on the prior that it is low-rank.",,arg_structuring,0
The proposed strategy is demonstrated in stochastic control tasks and reinforcement learning applications.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper is clearly written and the experimental results show that the proposed strategy leads to performance gains especially in problems where the Q matrix indeed conforms to a low-rank model.,,arg_evaluative,0
A few comments and questions:,,arg_structuring,0
- The assumption that the Q matrix should be low-rank is demonstrated with several experiments.,,arg_fact,0
Is there any theoretical motivation or guarantee for this assumption as well?,,arg_request,1
"- The experimental results show that the proposed strategy performs well in problems that are low-rank, while the performance may degrade in problems where the low-rank assumption is not met. Would it be possible to detect the rank of the problem in a dynamical manner (i.e., during the learning), so that the number of incomplete observations of Q can be increased to improve the performance, or the solution strategy (e.g. whether to use the low-rank assumption or not) can be adapted to the nature of the problem?",,arg_request,1
- The Q-value matrices and functions considered in the problem have a special structure as they result from Markov Decision Processes. Would it be possible to go beyond the low-rank assumption and propose and use a more elaborate type of prior that employs the special structure of MDPs?,,arg_request,1

The paper gives an example of Gaussian mean field inference.,,arg_structuring,0
"Ultimately, the analysis boils down to looking at a signal-to-noise ratio of the algorithm, which looks very much like regularization.",,arg_structuring,0
"I think this is a very interesting direction, but the present paper is somewhat unclear.",,arg_evaluative,0

"Furthermore, for training, PARCUS makes use of rationales.",,arg_structuring,0
"Those are indicators of input importance, and help to boost the loss for relevant tokens.",,arg_structuring,0
The main motivation to use PARCUS is that it works better in a low-resource setting than recent state-of-the-art models for the high-resource case.,,arg_evaluative,0
This is due to it having relatively few parameters and to it having a strong inductive bias.,,arg_evaluative,0

==========,,arg_other,0
"Update: After reading the other reviews and the responses by the authors, I lowered my score from 6 to 3.",,arg_evaluative,0
The main contributions of the submission are:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. A comprehensive empirical comparison of deep learning optimizers, with their performance compared under different amount of hyper-parameter tuning (they perform hyper-parameter tuning using random search).",,arg_structuring,0
"2. The introduction of a novel metric that tries to capture the ""tunability"" of an optimizer.",,arg_structuring,0
"This metric attempts to trade off the performance of an optimizer when tuned only with a small number of hyper-parameter trials, and its performance when carefully tuned.",,arg_structuring,0
"The metric is defined as a weighted average of the performance after tuning with i random trials, with i that goes from 1 to K.",,arg_structuring,0
"The weights of this weighted average and K are ""hyper-parameters"" of the metric itself.",,arg_structuring,0
They use K=100 and suggest 3 possible choices of weights.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper appears to treat 2. as the main contribution.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, I do not think the metric they introduce is good enough to be recommended in future work, when comparing tunability of optimizers (or other algorithms with hyperparameters).",,arg_evaluative,0
"The reason is that simpler methods provide just as much information, and do not rely on the need of interpreting the choice of the weights and K. This point is proven in the paper itself, where for example Figure 2 provides a more concrete and easier to interpret information than the tunability metric, similar graphs could be easily provided per dataset.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Similarly, figure 3 as well as figures 5-7 and 8 in the appendix provide very good information about the tunability of the various optimizers without using the introduced metrics.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Information similar (although not identical) to that summarized in table 5 could be captured by substituting the 3 metrics with the best performance after tuning for 4, 16 and 64 iterations respectively (just as examples).",,arg_evaluative,0
"A stronger contribution is 1., which however is somewhat incremental compared to similar comparisons made in the past.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Comparisons which, while mentioned, should perhaps have been discussed and compared more in detail in this work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall, I do not feel the comparisons dramatically change the qualitative understanding the field has of the different optimizers and their tunability.",,arg_evaluative,0
"They also suggest that when the tuning budget is low, using Adam but tuning only the learning rate is beneficial, which could be a valuable and practical suggestion.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I enjoyed reading the submission, which is very clearly written, but due to the relatively limited value of the contributions, and excessive focus on the tunability metric which I do not feel is giustified, I slightly lean against acceptance here at ICLR. I do think, however, that it would make a great submission to a smaller venue or workshop.",,arg_evaluative,0
Other comments/notes:,,arg_structuring,0
"* One aspects that is mostly left out of the discussion (except from one side comment) is the wallclock time, as some optimizers might be on average quicker to train (for example due to quicker convergence), this can easily lead it to be quicker to tune even though it requires a higher budget of trials.",,arg_evaluative,0
I think it would be worth discussing this more.,,arg_request,1
"* minor: in figure 8 in the appendix, the results after 100 iterations is, as far as I understand, over a single replication, so is not particularly reliable (and will always be 100% of a single optimizer)",,arg_evaluative,0
"* similarly to the above, if the configurations are always sampled from the same 100, confidence intervals in the graphs become less reliable as the budget increases.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The paper proposes a neural-network-based estimation of mutual information, following the earlier line of work in [A].",,arg_structuring,0
The main focus has been to develop an estimator that can reliably work with small dataset sizes.,,arg_structuring,0
They first reduce the sample complexity of estimating mutual information by decoupling the network learning problem and the estimation problem by creating a training and validation set and then using the validation set for estimating mutual information.,,arg_structuring,0
"Of course, there is still the problem of learning the network with smaller sized data.",,arg_structuring,0
"For this, they propose the strategy of creating multiple tasks from the same dataset, where the dataset is run through transformations that do not affect mutual information.",,arg_structuring,0
I am inclined to accept (weak) the paper for the following reasons:,,arg_structuring,0
1. The paper uses some nice ideas to reduce the variance of the MI estimates and to be able to work with smaller dataset sizes.,,arg_evaluative,0
Both splitting data into training and validation and then using task augmentation to make learning robust are pretty nice ideas.,,arg_evaluative,0
"2. The results on the synthetic datasets show that the resulting estimator does have low variance and the estimates are less than or equal to the true MI value, which is consistent with the fact that it is a lower bound estimation.",,arg_evaluative,0
3. The results on fMRI dataset were interesting and showed that the method gives improvements over baselines were the estimates were made on a smaller sized dataset.,,arg_evaluative,0
Some improvement suggestions:,,arg_structuring,0
1. I don't see why MINE cannot be applied to the fMRI dataset and results be reported.,,arg_request,1
"I know that the variance in estimation is large, but it would still be useful to look at the performance of MINE in comparison to DEMINE.",,arg_other,0
"2. There are several errors in the writing - hyperparamters in Abstract, repetition of the word ""Section"" in fMRI experiment section etc. - which needs to be fixed.",,arg_request,1
"[A] Mutual Information Neural Estimation, ICML 2018",,arg_other,0

Detailed comments and questions:,,arg_structuring,0
"- In the paper, the states are represented by only object positions (x, y, z). Is this sufficient? (e.g. velocity is unnecessary?)",,arg_request,1
"- For MISC, the additional assumption is required: the agent should know that which parts of the states are its own controllable state and object's state respectively.",,arg_fact,0
Is this additional assumption realistic enough and has it been adopted in other previous works? Is there any way to discriminate robot states and object states automatically?,,arg_request,1
"- Can MISC deal with the problems where the number of objects of interest is more than two? In this case, how can we define mutual information?",,arg_request,1
"- In Eq. (4), T(x_1:N, y_1:N) is assumed to be decomposable into the sum of T(x_t, y_t) / N. Can this make the lower bound (Eq. (3)) arbitrarily loose since the class of functions becomes very limited?",,arg_request,1
- Detailed experimental setups are missing.,,arg_evaluative,0
"e.g. network architecture, hyper-parameters (e.g. I_tran^max), and how they were searched.",,none,0
"- Similarly to the problem of sparse reward, if the robot and the object are far apart and it is difficult to reach the object with random exploration, it would also be difficult to train the mutual information discriminator. How was the discriminator trained? How many time steps were used to train MI discriminator?",,arg_request,1
- It seems that the MI discriminator learns to estimate the 'proximity' between the robot and the object.,,arg_fact,0
"Compared to using just a very simple dense reward (e.g. negative L2 distance between the robot and the object), what would be the advantage of using MI discriminator? It would be great to show the comparison between using simple dense reward and MI discriminator for each Push, Pick&Place, and Slide task.",,arg_request,1
"- For the MISC+DIAYN, what if we train the agent using MISC and DIAYN at the same time, instead of pre-training MISC first and fine-tuning DIAYN later?",,arg_request,1

"- Also, for MISC-r experiments, the weights between the intrinsic reward bonus and the extrinsic reward are not specified in the paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
- It seems that MISC is beneficial when the robot should get closer to the object for the success of the task.,,arg_fact,0
"Then, how about the opposite situation? What if the task requires that the robot should 'avoid' the object of interest? Does MISC still work? Is it helpful for the improvement of sample efficiency?",,arg_request,1
"- In order to pre-train the discriminator network, additional (s,a,s') experiences are required, thus it seems difficult to say that it is better for exploration than VIME.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- In section 4.3, what happens if we transfer the learned discriminator to Pick&Place from Push that has a gripper fixed to be closed, rather than the opposite direction (i.e. from Pick&Place to Push)?

The usefulness of the learned features is evaluated with linear probes at each layer for either ImageNet or CiFAR image classification.,,arg_structuring,0

Comments / Questions,,arg_structuring,0
"It seems to me that for completeness, Table 4 should include the result of training a supervised network on top of random conv1/2 and Scattering network features, because this experiment is actually testing what we want - performance of the features when fine-tuned for a downstream task.",,arg_request,1
"So for example, even if a linear classifier on top of Scattering features does poorly, if downstream fine-tuning results in the same performance as another pre-training method, then Scattering is a perfectly fine approach for initial features.",,arg_request,1
Could the authors please either correct this logic or provide the experiments?,,arg_social,0
"Further, it seems that the results in Table 4 might be a bit obscured by the size of the downstream task dataset.",,arg_evaluative,0
I wonder if the learned features require fewer fully supervised images to obtain the same performance on the downstream task?,,arg_request,1
Can the authors clarify how the neural style transfer experiment is performed?,,arg_request,1
"The method from Gatys et al. requires features from different layers of the feature hierarchy, including deeper layers.",,arg_fact,0

"I disagree with the claim of practicality in the introduction (page 2, top).",,arg_evaluative,0

*** Increased to weak accept after discussion of merits of ME bias was improved in the paper ***,,arg_fact,0
"This paper investigates whether neural networks exhibit a ‘mutual exclusivity (ME) bias’, whereby novel inputs tend to be associated with previously unseen outputs, an inductive bias that is cited to be present in children when learning to associate new words and objects.",,arg_structuring,0
"Via three different sets of experiments, the authors conclude that, under standard training procedures, neural networks in fact display an anti-ME bias: when faced with a novel input, they tend to assign less probability mass to unobserved outputs than is justified by the incoming data.",,none,0
The authors go on to argue that explicitly designing neural networks to reason by mutual exclusivity could lead to faster and more flexible learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"While the experiments across several domains convincingly show the presence of an anti-ME bias in neural network training, I recommend that the paper be rejected because it falls short in demonstrating to what extent performance could be improved by correcting or reversing this bias.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors pose an interesting hypothesis, but it would gain a lot of credibility if they could provide an empirical analysis of an algorithm that uses ME reasoning to improve learning in a realistic setting or if they could at least perform some quantitative analysis of the effects of ME bias on task performance for a toy example.",,arg_evaluative,0
Comments / questions:,,arg_structuring,0
"* The authors duly acknowledge that ME bias is not necessarily desirable in all circumstances, namely in tasks that feature many-to-one mappings, citing polysemy and synonymy in machine translation as examples.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Without an empirical example in a realistic setting, it is hard to judge whether the benefits of introducing an ME bias for better classification of new inputs belonging to new classes can outweigh the negatives via a potential increase in misclassification of those belonging to old classes.",,arg_evaluative,0
"* For the synthetic dataset one-to-one mapping of one-hot vectors it is clear that an ME bias would incur an advantage for classification on a zero-shot basis, i.e. an increased an accuracy for the first time a new input is observed. Is ME bias considered to be useful here because (i) we care directly about improving this type of zero-shot classification, or is it (ii) because it's implicitly assumed that a better initial prediction will lead to faster learning on these examples?",,arg_request,1
*,,none,0
"If it is (i) we care about, then it would be useful to quantify the advantage gained either empirically or analytically.",,none,0
It’s not obvious to me how useful the ME bias would be when there is a large number of classes since the probability assigned to the true novel class with a perfect ME bias would be 1 / (# unseen classes).,,arg_evaluative,0
"So at the beginning of training, while there are lots of new classes to benefit from the ME bias, the maximum advantage per example is small, and vice versa at the end of training - how do these conflicting effects balance each other out over the course of training and how do the benefits of ME bias scale with the number of classes?",,arg_request,1
"Presumably, whether the benefit scales well will depend on the loss function - in any case, this warrants some analysis/discussion especially given that there are no experiments to test it.",,arg_evaluative,0
"* The authors say that “ME can be generalized from applying to 'novel versus familiar’ stimuli to instead handling ‘rare versus frequent’ stimuli” and they cite the fact that neural networks take longer to learn from rare stimuli, suggesting that ME could help for reason (ii) above.",,arg_fact,0
It’s not obvious to me that ME bias will provide a significant advantage in a one-shot or few-shot learning setting - i.e. how useful is having made a better initial guess (which is random amongst the unseen classes) after you gain some specific information about the target class? Perhaps the benefit is small relative to that of the one-shot or few-shot information gained - I think this needs to be quantified empirically.,,arg_evaluative,0

"Admittedly this is a difficult question to quantify, but my point is to question whether the anti-ME bias shown in Figure 6 is necessarily suboptimal, given the difficulty of classifying a new image as a new class or not.",,none,0

Experimental results show significant improvement over vanilla adversarial training.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is nicely written and the experimental results are quite strong and comprehensive. I really like the paper but I have two questions about the results:,,arg_evaluative,0
1. The numbers reported in Figure 5 do not match with the performance of adversarial training in previous paper.,,arg_fact,0
"In PGM L_inf adversarial training/attack (column 3 of Figure 5), the prediction accuracy is roughly 50% under 0.1 infinity norm perturbation.",,arg_fact,0
"However, previous papers (e.g., ""Obfuscated Gradients Give a False Sense of Security"") reported 55% accuracy under 0.031 infinity norm perturbation.",,arg_fact,0
I wonder why the numbers are so different.,,arg_request,1
"Maybe it's because of different scales? Previous works usually scale each pixel to [0,1] or [-1,1], maybe the authors use the [0, 255] scale? But 0.1/255 will be much smaller than 0.031.",,arg_request,1
"Another factor might be the model structure. If Alexnet has much lower accuracy, it's probably worthwhile to conduct experiments on the same structure with previous works (Madry et al and Athalye et al) to make the conclusion more clear.",,arg_other,0
2. What's the training time of the proposed method compared with vanilla adversarial training?,,arg_request,1
3. The idea of using SN to improve robustness has been introduced in the following paper:,,arg_fact,0

"This study primarily centers around an initially somewhat surprising result that non-trivial policies can be learned for many ’simpler’ video games (e.g., Atari, Super Mario, Pong) using just curiosity as reward.",,arg_structuring,0
"While this is primarily an empirical study, one aspect considered was the observation representation (raw pixels, random features, VAE, and inverse dynamics features [Pathak, et al., ICML17]).",,arg_structuring,0
"In examining reward curves (generally extrinsic during testing), ‘curiosity-based’ reward generally works with the representation effectiveness varying across different testbeds.",,arg_structuring,0
"They also conduct more in-depth experiments on specific testbeds to study the dynamics (e.g., Super Mario, Juggling, Ant Robot, Multi-agent Pong) — perhaps most interestingly showing representation-based transfer of different embeddings across levels in Super Mario.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, they consider the Unity maze testbed, combining intrinsic rewards with the end-state goal reward to generate a more dense reward space.",,arg_structuring,0
"From a high level perspective, this is an interesting result that ostensibly will lead to a fair amount of discussion within the RL community (and already has based on earlier versions of this work).",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, it isn’t entirely clear if the primary contribution is showing that ‘curiosity reward’ is a potentially promising approach or if game environments aren’t particularly good testbeds for practical RL algorithms — given the lack of significant results on more realistic domains, my intuition leans toward the later (the ant robot is interesting, but one can come up with ‘simulator artifact’ based explanations).",,arg_evaluative,0
"And honestly, I think the paper reads as if leaning toward the same conclusion.",,none,0
"Regardless, given the prevalence of these types of testbed environments, either is a useful discussion to have. Maybe the end result could minimally be a new baseline that can help quantify the ‘difficulty’ of a particular environment.",,arg_request,1
"From the perspective of a purely technical contribution, there are fewer exciting results.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The basic method is taken from [Parthak, et al., ICML17] (modulo some empirical choices such as using PPO).",,arg_fact,0
"The comparison of different observation representations doesn’t include any analytical component, the empirical component is primarily inconclusive, and the position statements are fairly non-controversial (and not really conclusively supported).",,arg_evaluative,0
The testbeds all existed previously and this is mostly the effort of pulling then together.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Even the ‘focused experiments’ can be explained with the intuitive narrative that in the state/action space, there is always more uncertainty the farther one goes from the starting point and this is more of a result of massive computation being applied primarily to problems that are designed to provide some level of novelly (the Roboschool examples are a bit more interesting, but also less conclusive).",,arg_request,1
"Finally, Figure 5 is interesting in showing that ‘curiosity + extrinsic’ improves over extrinsic rewards — although this isn’t particularly surprising for maze navigation that has such sparse rewards and can be viewed as something like ‘active exploration’.",,arg_evaluative,0
"With respect to this specific setting, the authors may want to consider [Mirowski, et al., Learning to Navigate in Complex Environments, ICLR17] with respect to auxiliary loss + RL extrinsic rewards to improve performance (in this case, also in maze environments).",,arg_request,1
"In just considering the empirical results, they clearly entail a fair amount of effort and just a dump of the code and experiments on the community will likely lead to new findings (even if they are that game simulators are weaker testbeds than previously thought).",,arg_fact,0
"It is easy to ask for additional experiments (i.e., other mechanisms of uncertainty such as the count-based discussed in related work, other settings in 2.2) — but the quality seems high enough that I basically trust the settings and findings.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Beyond the core findings, the other settings are less convincingly supported by seem more like work in progress and this paper is really just a scaling-up of [Pathak, et al., ICML17] without generating any strong results regarding questions around representation, what to do about stochasticity (although the discussion regarding something like ‘curiosity honeypots’ is interesting).",,arg_evaluative,0
"Thus, it reads like one interesting finding around curiosity-driven RL working in games plus a bunch of preliminary findings trying to grasp at some explanations and potential future directions.",,arg_structuring,0

=== Pros ===,,arg_structuring,0
+ demonstrates that curiosity-based reward works in simpler game environments,,arg_evaluative,0
+ (implicitly) calls into question the value of these testbed environments,,arg_evaluative,0
"+ well written, with a large set of experiments and some interesting observations/discussions",,arg_evaluative,0
=== Cons ===,,arg_structuring,0
- little methodological innovation or analytical explanations,,arg_evaluative,0
- offers minimal (but some) evidence that curiosity-based reward works in more realistic settings,,arg_evaluative,0
- doesn’t answer the one question regarding observation representation that it set out to evaluate,,arg_evaluative,0
"- the more interesting problem, RL + auxiliary loss isn’t evaluated in detail",,arg_evaluative,0
"- presumably, the sample complexity is ridiculous",,arg_evaluative,0
"Overall, I am ambivalent.",,arg_social,0
"I think that more casual ML/RL researchers will find these results controversial and surprising while more experienced researchers will see curiosity-driven learning to be explainable primarily by the intuition of the “The fact that the curiosity reward is often sufficient” paragraph of page 6, demanding more complex environments before accepting that this form of curiosity is particularly useful.",,arg_structuring,0
The ostensible goal of learning more about observation representations is mostly preliminary — and this direction holds promise of for a stronger set of findings.,,arg_fact,0
Dealing with highly stochastic environments seems a potential fatal flaw of the assumptions of this method.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, as I said previously, this is probably a discussion worth having given the popularity and visibility of game-based testbeds — so, coupled with the overall quality of the paper, I lean toward a weak accept.",,arg_other,0
This paper proposes to relax the assumption of disentangled representation and encourage the model to learn linearly manipulable representations.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper assumes that the latent canonicalizers are predefined for each task and that it is possible to obtain the ground-truth image of different latent canonicalizations.,,arg_structuring,0
I find these assumptions too strong for the task of learning disentangled representation.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Firstly, most prior works such as beta-vae, info-gan do not assume that the factors / canonicalizers are known beforehand.",,arg_fact,0
"In fact, this is a very difficult part of learning disentangled representation.",,arg_fact,0
"Secondly, if it is possible to obtain the ground-truth image of different latent canonicalizations, you can simply train a network to predict the canonicalizations by simple supervised learning.",,arg_fact,0
"Hence, these overly simplified and unrealistic assumptions make the task too trivial.",,arg_evaluative,0
The proposed method is very simple and frames the problem basically as a supervised learning problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Although experiments show that learning such representations are beneficial for low-shot setting of SVHN, it is not clear whether such improvement generalizes to more realistic datasets such as ImageNet.",,arg_evaluative,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"In the semi-supervised self-training setting, this paper proposes to select a certain subset of unlabelled data for training rather than all unlabelled data, where the ensemble of confidence scores of the trained model in iterations is used to guide the selection.",,arg_structuring,0
Strong points:,,arg_structuring,0
"It is a good idea to conduct an ensemble based on the confidence scores of trained models in iterations, although the authors did not mention any theoretical explanation or guarantee behind this.",,arg_evaluative,0
Weak points:,,arg_structuring,0
"1) Although the ensemble idea is new, the idea of selective self-training is not novel in self-training or co-training of SSL as in the following survey.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Considering the selection based on highest-confidence, the in or out of class unlabeled data in most cases does not matter.",,arg_fact,0
"Therefore, the technical contribution of this paper is moderate.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Zhu, Xiaojin. ""Semi-supervised learning literature survey."" Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison 2.3 (2006): 4.",,arg_evaluative,0
2) The writing is poor and hard to follow.,,arg_evaluative,0
"First, many details are missing, especially in the experiments, which makes the proposed method suspicious and non-convincing.",,arg_request,1
"For example, what is the number_iterations in the experiments? How are they chosen or what's the specific stopping criteria?",,arg_request,1
"From the plots in Figure 2 and 3, it is hard to find the convergence of the method within 100 iterations.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The descriptions of the datasets used are not clear, e.g., the number of classes for each data.",,arg_request,1
"Second, many typos and grammar errors need to fix, e.g., ""the proposed SST is suitable for lifelong learning which make use..."", ""the error 21.44% was lower than"" 18.97?",,arg_request,1
3) The overall performance of the proposed SST in the experiments is not convincing and not promising.,,arg_evaluative,0
"First, the labeled data portion is fixed and is relatively high",,arg_evaluative,0
compared to most standard semi-supervised learning settings,,none,0
.,,none,0
"Second, SST itself is only comparable with or even worse than the state-of-art methods.",,arg_evaluative,0

"However, the additional cost is expensive.",,arg_fact,0
Further demonstrations are necessary for the proposed SST method.,,arg_request,1
This paper uses constrained Markov decision processes to solve a multi-objective problem that aims to find the correct trade-off between cost and return in continuous control.,,arg_structuring,0

Comments:,,arg_structuring,0
1) How to solve the constrained problem (8) is unclear.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is prefer to provide detailed description or pseudocode for this step.,,none,0

"How do we choose a proper beta, and will the algorithm be sensitive to beta?",,arg_evaluative,0
3) The paper only conducts comparison experiments with fixed-alpha baselines.,,arg_evaluative,0
The topic is similar to safe reinforcement learning.,,none,0
Including the comparison with safe reinforcement learning algorithms is more convincing.,,none,0
"In this paper, the authors focus on alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors propose a discriminative variational autoencoder (DiVA) to solve this problem under the generative replay framework.,,arg_structuring,0
DiVA modifies the objective function of VAE by introducing an additional term that maximizes the mutual information between the latent variables and the class labels.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors do not thoroughly explain the motivation of this paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors do not explicitly define continual learning, incremental learning, and catastrophic forgetting problem.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is also not clear to me why these problems are important.,,arg_evaluative,0
The idea that introduces labels in VAE is not novel.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, Narayanaswamy et al. [1] also propose to utilize labels to VAE.",,arg_evaluative,0
I do not understand why making use of labels is important for solving the catastrophic forgetting problem and how the labels are useful in the generative replay process.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is also not clear to me how domain translation is relevant to continual learning.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In terms of modeling, since the input into the prior network has finite possible discrete values, we do not need a fully connected network to generate $\hat{\mu}_c$ and $\hat{\sigma}_c$. Instead, we can directly optimize $\hat{\mu}_c$ and $\hat{\sigma}_c$ for each $c$ as parameters.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper provides some good experimental results.,,arg_evaluative,0
But the problem settings are not clear to me.,,arg_evaluative,0
I do not understand how the model is trained to solve multiple tasks.,,arg_evaluative,0
Do the same model is trained for multiple tasks? Is each of the tasks trained sequentially or simultaneously?,,arg_request,1

"In summary, since DiVA gives a good experimental performance, the proposed method might be promising.",,arg_evaluative,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
"The manuscript proposes a multi-domain adversarial learning (MDL) method called MULANN, to leverage multiple datasets with overlapping but distinct class sets, in a semi-supervised setting.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors define a new discrimination task to discriminate, within each domain, labeled samples from unlabeled ones that most likely belong to extra classes (classes with no labeled or unlabeled samples in the domain).",,arg_structuring,0
"They also introduce a bound on the average- and worst-domain risk in MDL, obtained using the H-divergence.",,arg_structuring,0
Strengths:,,arg_structuring,0
- The idea of using discriminators for separating the labeled samples from unlabeled ones that most likely belong to extra classes is interesting.,,arg_evaluative,0
- A new generalization bound for MDL is introduced.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- The paper was clear, well written, well-motivated and nicely structured.",,arg_evaluative,0
"- The authors perform numerous empirical experiments on several types of problems on various datasets (Digit, OFFICE,CELL) successfully showing how the MULANN can reduce the nasty effects of the adversarial domain discriminator and repulse (a fraction of) unlabeled examples from labeled ones in each domain.",,arg_evaluative,0
Weaknesses:,,arg_structuring,0
- all the experiments except the last row of Table 2 concern adaptation between two domains.,,arg_fact,0
"Given the paper title, the reviewer would have expected more experiments in a multiple domain context.",,arg_evaluative,0
"More precisely, for the digit datasets, the reviewer was interested to see how the proposed MDL performs on jointly adapting SVHN, MNIST, MNIST-M, and USPS or jointly adapting DSLR, Amazon, and Webcam for OFFICE dataset.",,arg_request,1
"Moreover, comparison with some of the DA baselines (ADDA[1], DSN[2]) is missing.",,arg_request,1
- The authors propose to rank the unlabeled samples of each domain according to the entropy of their classification of the current classifier.,,arg_fact,0
Obviously there must be some false ranking (specially at the initial stages of updating the classifier) for the unlabeled samples (e.g. the classifier may output high entropy for the unlabeled samples of the classes with labeled samples) and they may harm the performance of adaptation.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is not clear how MULANN can work in this situation and how its performance vary with the noisy signals conveyed in those false pseudolabeled samples.,,arg_evaluative,0
"- Although the paper introduces the generalization bound for MDL, it does not give new formulation or algorithm to handle MDL (MULANN handles only the class asymmetry when domains involve distinct sets of classes and it has nothing to do with MDL).",,arg_fact,0
"hence, there is no connection between the theoretical results on MDL generalization bound and the proposed method MULANN.",,arg_evaluative,0
-,,arg_structuring,0

The question asked is whether or not pretrained mean-field RBMs can help in preventing adversarial attacks.,,arg_structuring,0
"However, there are some key issues with the paper that are not clear.",,arg_evaluative,0
The first is regarding the structure of the paper.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors combine two ideas, 1: the training of MF RBMs and 2: the the ability to prevent adversarial attacks.",,arg_structuring,0
"The combination of ideas is ok, however, it is unclear how novel or how good is the proposed MF training of the RBMs.",,arg_evaluative,0
It would make the paper much stronger if the authors perform quantitative + qualitative evaluation on the MF training of RBMs first.,,arg_request,1
"Without doing so, it leaves the reader wondering why not simply a standard RBM trained using a standard method (e.g. contrastive divergence).",,arg_evaluative,0
"In a related note, using MF for training BMs have been proposed previously and found to not work due to various reasons:",,arg_evaluative,0
see paragraph after equation 8 of the Deep BM paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/salakhutdinov09a/salakhutdinov09a.pdf,,arg_other,0
"It would be very interesting to contrast the proposed method with other previously proposed MF based method, in particular using Free energy to approximate the expectation of the model without constraints.",,arg_request,1
"It is also unclear how the calculation of relative entropy ""D"" was performed in figure 3.",,arg_evaluative,0
Obtaining the normalized marginal density in a BM is very challenging due to the partition function.,,arg_fact,0
The second part of the paper associate good performance in preventing adversarial attacks with the possibility of denoising by the pretrained BM.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This is a very good point, however the paper do not compare or contrast with existing methods.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, it is curious to see how denoising Auto encoders would perform.",,arg_request,1
"In addition, it could be worthwhile to compare and benchmark on existing evaluations: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06806.pdf",,arg_request,1
"- The authors should make a distinction on what kinds of attack is considered: white box, black box or grey box.",,arg_request,1
Defending against black box attacks is considerably easier than defending against white-box attacks.,,arg_fact,0

of the proposed MF BMs in increasing robustness against adversarial attacks.,,none,0
This work is focused on learning 3D object representations (decoders) that can be computed more efficiently than existing methods.,,arg_structuring,0
"The computational inefficiency of these methods is that you learn a (big) fixed decoder for all objects (all z latents), and then need to apply it individually on either each point cloud point you want to produce, or each voxel in the output (this problem exists for both the class of methods that deform a uniform distribution R^3 -> R^3 a la FoldingNet, or directly predict the 3D function R^3 -> R e.g. DeepSDF).",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors propose that the encoder directly predict the weights and biases of a decoder network that, since it is specific to the particular object being reconstructed, can be much smaller and thus much cheaper to compute.",,arg_structuring,0
"The authors then note the fact that their method lacks a continuous latent space that allows for interpolation, as provided by existing (VAE-like) methods.",,arg_structuring,0
"They propose to solve this by learning an MLP that produces the output by recurrent application, and then composing subapplications of different networks as a type of interpolation.",,arg_structuring,0
-------------------,,arg_structuring,0
"I like this work, it addresses a real problem in a number of models for 3D representation learning (similar models are also used for e.g. cryo-EM reconstruction).",,arg_evaluative,0
"While the fast weights approach is not totally original, its application to this problem is novel and very well-suited to it.",,arg_evaluative,0
I was a bit surprised by just how much the decoder network could be shrunk by using fast weights.,,arg_evaluative,0
The paper is also quite well written.,,arg_evaluative,0
I especially like how Section 2 synthesizes existing work into model categories which make it easier to think about their relationships.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I also think the explanation in Sec. 3.2, while kind of obvious, is a nice way think about decoder vs. fast weights.",,arg_evaluative,0
I like that the authors are straightforward about the deficiency of the method (i.e. that you can't interpolate in latent space).,,arg_evaluative,0
Their proposed solution of functional composition is exceedingly clever but in my opinion too impractical to really be useful.,,arg_evaluative,0
"It adds extra complexity, requires you to do function composition which may be less expressive and takes more coomputation, etc. And to what end?",,arg_evaluative,0
The purpose of generative models is not to interpolate per se; the interpolation is really a sanity check that the model is capturing the underlying distribution rather than just memorizing training examples.,,arg_fact,0
The function composition doesn't capture that.,,arg_evaluative,0
I think the authors should just acknowledge that you can't soundly *sample* from their generative model the way e.g. VAE or GAN allows (their function composition is not a sampling method).,,arg_request,1
"But I think there are lots of useful things you can do without that capability, e.g. do 3D point cloud completion, go image -> structure, etc.",,arg_fact,0

"1. the NPN model seems a good alternative, will be good to have a discussion about why your model is better than NPN.",,arg_request,1

I will be curious to know how it performs.,,arg_request,1
2. A more detailed illustration of the system / network is needed. Would have made it much easier to understand the paper.,,arg_request,1
3. What are the results when using the whole training set of Recipes ?,,arg_request,1
"The paper proposes doubly sparse, which is a sparse mixture of sparse experts and learns a two-level class hierarchy, for efficient softmax inference.",,arg_structuring,0
[+] It reduces computational cost compared to full softmax.,,arg_evaluative,0
"[+] Ablation study is done for group lasso, expert lasso and load balancing, which help understand the effect of different components of the proposed",,arg_evaluative,0
"[-] It seems to me the motivation is similar to that of Sparsely-Gated MoE (Shazeer et al. 2017), but it is not clear how the proposed two-hierarchy method is superior to the Sparsely-Gated MoE. It would be helpful the paper discuss more about this.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Besides, in evaluation, the paper only compares Doubly Sparse with full softmax.",,arg_evaluative,0

The paper focuses on the generalization performance of RNNs and its variant in a theoretical perspective.,,arg_structuring,0
"Compared to the previous result (Zhang et al., 2018) for RNNs, this paper refines the generalization bounds for vanilla RNNs in all cases and fills the blank for RNN variants like MGU and LSTM.",,arg_structuring,0
"Specifically, in the work of Zhang et al. (2018), the complexity term quadratically depends on the layer (or say, current sequence length, denoted by t in original paper), making it less instructive.",,arg_structuring,0
"This paper improves it to at most linear dependence and can achieve at logarithmic dependence in some cases, which should be accredited.",,arg_structuring,0
The key step in the proof is Lemma 2.,,arg_structuring,0
"In Lemma 2, the spectral norms of weight matrices and the number of weight parameters are decoupled.",,arg_structuring,0
"With Lemma 2, it is natural to construct a epsilon-net for RNNs and then upper bound the empirical Rademacher complexity by Dudley’s entropy integral, since such methodology is not so novel.",,arg_structuring,0
"Bartlett, et al. (2017) developed this technique to analyze the generalization bound for neural networks in a margin-based multiclass classification.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, it seems a little unexplainable to apply a technique developed from classification to analyze RNNs, since the main task of RNNs never should be classification.",,arg_evaluative,0
I wonder the motivation of analyzing generalization of RNNs by the techniques established by Bartlett.,,arg_request,1
This paper proposed a new pooling method (Frequency pooling) which is strict shift equivalent and anti-aliasing in theory.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors first derived the theory of F-pooling to be optimal anti-aliasing down sampling and is shift-equivalent in sec 2, and then demonstrated the experimental results of 1D signals and image classification tasks.",,arg_structuring,0
The experimental results are actually less impressive than what are claimed in contribution and conclusion.,,arg_evaluative,0
"The authors stated that ""F-pooling remarkably increases accuracy and robustness w.r.t. shifts of moderns CNNs""; however, in Table 1-3, the winning margin of accuracy is actually quite small (<2%), and the consistency (<3.5% compared to the second best baseline except resnet-18 on CIFAR 100 has large improvement ~7-8%).",,arg_evaluative,0
Questions:,,arg_structuring,0
"1. For the experiment of 1D signal on sine wave, the AA-pooling and F-pooling give the same result?",,arg_request,1
"2. Compared to AA-pooling, it seems that F-pooling has a better theoretical guarantee (i.e. the optimal anti-aliasing down sampling operation given U).",,arg_evaluative,0
"But other than this, the empirical performance seem not showing particular advantage over AA-pooling.",,arg_evaluative,0
Are there any other advantages for F-pooling s.t. people might want to use it as opposed to AA-pooling?,,arg_request,1
3. What are the limitations of the F-pooling? It is good to me that the authors discuss one limitation on the imaginary part of output and I would like to hear more on other potential limitations for this method.,,arg_request,1
"- also, if the authors can explain more on sec 2.5 it will be helpful. If we simply ignore the imaginary part, although the theory is not applicable, but what would the empirical performance be?",,arg_request,1
This paper proposes to address few-shot learning in a transductive way by learning a label propagation model in an end-to-end manner.,,arg_structuring,0
Semi-supervised few-shot learning is important considering the limitation of the very few labeled instances.,,arg_structuring,0
This is an interesting work.,,arg_evaluative,0
The merits of this paper lie in the following aspects: (1) It is the first to learn label propagation for transductive few-shot learning.,,arg_evaluative,0
(2) The proposed approach produced effective empirical results.,,arg_evaluative,0
The drawbacks  of the work include the following: (1) There is not much technical contribution.,,arg_evaluative,0
It merely just puts the CNN representation learning and the label propagation together to perform end-to-end learning.,,arg_fact,0
"Considering the optimization problem involved in the learning process, it is hard to judge whether the effect of such a procedure from the optimization perspective.",,arg_evaluative,0
"(2) Empirically, it seems TPN achieved very small improvements over the very baseline label propagation.",,arg_structuring,0
"Moreover, the performance reported in this paper seems to be much inferior to the state-of-the-art results reported in the literature.",,arg_evaluative,0
"For example,  on miniImageNet, TADAM(Oreshkin et al, 2018) reported 58.5 (1-shot) and 76.7(5-shot), which are way better than the results reported in this work.",,arg_fact,0
This is a major concern.,,arg_fact,0
This paper proposes new pre-training strategies for GNN with both a node-level and a graph-level pretraining.,,arg_structuring,0
"For the node-level pretraining, the goal is to map nodes with similar surrounding structures to nearby context (similarly to word2vec).",,arg_structuring,0
The main problem is that directly predicting the context is intractable because of combinatorial explosion.,,arg_evaluative,0
The main idea is then to use an additional GNN to encode the context and to learn simultaneously the main GNN and the context GNN via negative sampling.,,arg_structuring,0
Another method used is attribute masking where some masked node and edge attributes need to be predicted by the GNN.,,arg_structuring,0
"For graph-level pretraining, some general graph properties need to be predicted by the graph.",,arg_structuring,0
Experiments are conducted on datasets in the chemistry domain and the biology domain showing the benefit of the pre-training.,,arg_structuring,0
The paper addresses an important and timely problem.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is a pity that the code is not provided.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In particular, the node-level pretraining described in section 3.1.1. seems rather complicated to implement as a context graph needs to be computed for each node in the graph.",,arg_evaluative,0
In particular I do not think the satement 'all the pre-training methods are at most linear with respect to the number of edges' made in appendix F is correct.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I take issue with the usage of the phrase ""skill discovery"".",,arg_evaluative,0
"In prior work (e.g. VIC, DIAYN), this meant learning a skill-conditional policy.",,arg_fact,0
"Here, there is only a single (unconditioned) policy, and the different ""skills"" come from modifications of the environment -- the number of skills is tied to the number of environments.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This is not to say that this way of doing things is wrong, but rather that it is misleading in the context of prior work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Skill discovery in this context implies being able to have a single agent execute a variety of learned skills, rather than having one agent per environment with each environment designed to elicit a specific skill.",,arg_fact,0
"Rather than ""skill discovery"", I suggest the authors position MISC relative to earlier work on empowerment, wherein a single policy was used to maximize mutual information of the form I(a; s_t | s_{t-1}).",,arg_request,1
Modifying the objective to incorporate domain knowledge (as done in your DIAYN baseline) yields I(a; s_i | s_{t-1}) and is amenable to maximization by either of the lower bounds considered here.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Indeed, your DIAYN baseline with skill length set to 1 and the number of skills equal to the number of actions (or same parameterization in the case of continuous actions) should recover this approach.",,arg_evaluative,0
"I believe this would be a much more appropriate baseline, and I'd be curious to hear the intuition for why I(s_c ; s_i) should be superior.",,arg_request,1
"Apart from this missing baseline, the experimental results seem convincing.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, it is unclear whether or not VIME and PER were modified to incorporate domain knowledge (i.e. s_i/s_c distinction).",,arg_request,1
"Indeed, an appendix would be greatly appreciated, as many experimental details were omitted.",,arg_request,1
"Ideally, an experimental setup with previously published results (e.g. control suite for DIAYN, Seaquest for DISCERN) would be considered, but I can understand why this wasn't done as incorporating domain knowledge is the main contribution of the paper.",,arg_request,1
"That said, the claims should be weakened to reflect this gap, and domain knowledge should be mentioned more prominently (e.g. states of interest vs context are given, not learned).",,arg_request,1
Rebuttal EDIT:,,arg_structuring,0
The language around skills and the extent of prior knowledge still downplays things a bit too much for my liking.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Needing new environment variations to obtain new skills is a large step backwards from things like DIAYN (the MISC/DIAYN combination needs more evidence to be considered a possible solution), and the s_i/s_c distinction is non-trivial to specify or learn for harder problems (e.g. pixel observations).",,arg_other,0
"That said, in the sort of settings under consideration (low dimensional state variables and environmental variations are simple to create) MISC does appear to be superior to prior work.",,arg_evaluative,0
"The empowerment baseline is much appreciated, and while modifications of PER and VIME that incorporate prior knowledge would've also been nice, the experimental results pass the bar for acceptance in my view.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposes an approach to construct surrogate objectives for the effective application of policy gradient methods to combinatorial optimization without known neighborhood structure.,,arg_structuring,0
The surrogate is constructed with the goal of reducing the need of hyper-parameter tuning and evaluated on a clique finding task.,,arg_structuring,0
"The proposed approach is very similar to the CE method by Rubinstein (as stated by the authors in the related work section), limiting the contributions of this paper.",,arg_evaluative,0
The proposed sampling distributions assumes independence between the random variables over which the authors optimize — I find it surprising that this leads to good empirical results,,arg_evaluative,0
are relatively little structure can be captured using this distribution.,,none,0
Can the authors elaborate on this?,,arg_request,1
"However, as also observed by the authors, the sampling distribution can also be replaced by more sophisticated distributions.",,arg_fact,0
"The empirical evaluation is limited in considering only one task (clique finding), and the results seem to be quite sensitive to the chosen optimizer.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper presents algorithms for solving computational problems in a datastream model augmented with an oracle learned from data.,,arg_structuring,0
"The authors show that under this model, there exist algorithms that have significantly better time and space complexity than the current best known algorithms that do not use an oracle.",,arg_structuring,0
The authors support their theoretical analysis with experiments in which the oracle is represented by a deep neural network and demonstrate improvement over classical algorithms that do not use machine learning.,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall, this paper seems like a solid contribution to the literature.",,arg_evaluative,0
"However, in its current state it does seem to be presented and motivated in a way that is appropriate for the audience of ML researchers at ICLR.",,arg_evaluative,0
"It reads very much like a STOC theory paper, and a lot of the key ML details that would be relevant to audience at this conference seem to have been shoved under the rug in a way.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Therefore my score for now is a weak reject, but I am very happy to increase the score if the authors address my presentations concerns.",,arg_social,0
Major comments:,,arg_structuring,0
* The oracle-augmented datasteam model needs to be contextualized better.,,arg_evaluative,0
I don't have a good sense of whether this is a reasonable theoretical model to explore and a lot of very basic questions remain unanswered for me.,,arg_evaluative,0
"For example, how do I even know that the oracle in question exists? What are the particular assumptions under which it exists? What are the requirements on the training data, optimization ability, generalization error, etc. How do we know that we can create in practice ML learning models that are sufficiently accurate to serve as an oracle?",,none,0

Minor comments:,,arg_structuring,0
* I thought there was a bit over-selling in intro.,,arg_evaluative,0

"However, you are in a different computational model in which you now have access to an oracle.",,arg_evaluative,0
"This needs to be made more explicitly, and language could be a bit toned down (e.g. in this model, we can obtain runtime that match or improve over lower bounds...)",,none,0
This paper presents a method for single image 3D reconstruction.,,arg_structuring,0
"It is inspired by implicit shape models, like presented in Park et al. and Mescheder et al., that given a latent code project 3D positions to signed distance, or occupancy values, respectively.",,arg_structuring,0
"However, instead of a latent vector, the proposed method directly outputs the network parameters of a second (mapping) network that displaces 3D points from a given canonical object, i.e., a unit sphere.",,arg_structuring,0
"As the second network maps 3D points to 3D points it is composable, which can be used to interpolate between different shapes.",,arg_structuring,0
"Evaluations are conducted on the standard ShapeNet dataset and the yields results close to the state-of-the-art, but using significantly less parameters.",,arg_structuring,0

On page 4 the mapping network is described as a function that maps c-dimensional points to 3D points.,,arg_structuring,0

Summary:,,arg_structuring,0
This paper proposes a generative point cloud model based on adversarial learning and definitti’s representation theorem of exchangeable variables.,,arg_structuring,0
"The main focus in experiments and the exposition is on 3D point clouds representing object shapes (seems the surface, but could also be the interior of objects, please clarify).",,arg_structuring,0
"The main idea is to represent a point cloud using a global latent variable that captures the overall shape, and a collection of local latent variables that code for the position of a point on the shape.",,arg_structuring,0
The model consists of thee components:,,arg_structuring,0
"(i) an “encoder” that takes a point cloud as input and maps it to a (point estimate of) the global latent variable of the shape represented by the input cloud, a point-net architecture is used here",,none,0
"(ii) a “decoder” that takes the estimated global latent variable, and a local latent variable, and maps it to an “output” point in the cloud to be produced by the model.",,none,0
"(iii) a “discriminator” network that aims to distinguish points from a *given* shape, and the points produced by pipe-lining the encoder and decoder.",,none,0
"Critically different from conventional GANs, the discriminator is optimized *per shape*, ie each point cloud is considered as a *distribution* over R^3 specific to that shape.",,none,0
"(iv) a “shape prior” that, once the encoder-decoder model from above is trained, is used to model the distribution over the global latent variables.",,none,0
"This model is trained, presumably, in a conventional GAN style using the global latent variable representations inferred across the different training point clouds.",,arg_structuring,0
"As compared to prior work by Achiloptas et al (2017), the proposed approach has the advantage to allow for sampling an arbitrary number of points from the target shape, rather than a fixed pre-defined number.",,arg_structuring,0
"In addition, the authors propose to minimize a weighted average of a lower bound and upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of points corresponding to given shapes.",,arg_structuring,0
"This approach translates to improved quantitative evaluation measures,",,none,0
"Experiments are conducted on a simple toy data set, as  a proof of concept, and on data from ModelNet10 and ModelNet40.",,none,0
Two performance metrics are introduced to assess the auto-encoding ability of the model: to what extent does the encoder-decoder pipeline result in point clouds similar to the shape from which the input point-cloud is generated.,,arg_structuring,0
"Overall I find the idea of the paper interesting and worth publishing, but the exposition of the paper is less than ideal and needs further work.",,arg_fact,0
"The experimental validation of the proposed approach can also be further improved, see more specific comments below.",,arg_fact,0

Attacking CRBMs is highly relevant and should be included as a baseline.,,arg_request,1
The only set of experiments are comparisons on first 500 MNIST test images.,,arg_evaluative,0
If the test set is not shuffled (by emphasis on first I assume not) these images are from training NIST (cleaner) set and may not include samples of all digits.,,arg_evaluative,0
Authors should clarify the justification behind experimenting only on 'first 500 test images'.,,arg_request,1
"Furthermore, as authors discussed the iterative weight sharing which increases the depth can vanish the gradient toward input.",,arg_structuring,0
Including at least one set of black box attacks is necessary to verify to what degree the vanishing gradient is the case here.,,arg_request,1
The iterative architecture is similar to the routing in CapsNet (Hinton 2018) in terms of weight sharing between successive layers.,,arg_fact,0
Although their network was resilient toward white box attacks they suffered from black box attacks.,,arg_fact,0
The boundary method on MNIST could be  weaker than a black box attack.,,arg_fact,0
This paper provide a method to produce adversarial attack using a Frank-Wolfe inspired method.,,arg_fact,0
I have some concerns about the motivation of this method:,,arg_structuring,0
- What are the motivations to use Frank-Wolfe ? Usually this algorithm is used when the constraints are to complicated to have a tractable projection (which is not the case for the L_2 and L_\infty balls) or when one wants to have sparse iterates which do not seem to be the case here.,,arg_request,1
- Consequently why did not you compare simple projected gradient method ?,,arg_request,1
(BIM) is not equivalent to the projected gradient method since the direction chosen is the sign of the gradient and not the gradient itself (the first iteration is actually equivalent because we start at the center of the box but after both methods are no longer equivalent).,,arg_fact,0
"- There is no motivations for the use of $\lambda >1$ neither practical or theoretical since the results are only proven for $\lambda =1$ whereas the experiments are done with \lambda = 5,20 or 30.",,arg_evaluative,0
- What is the difference between the result of Theorem 4.3 and the result from (Lacoste-Julien 2016)?,,arg_request,1
Depending on the answer to these questions I'm planning to move up or down my grade.,,arg_social,0
In the experiment there is no details on how you set the hyperparameters of CW and EAD.,,arg_evaluative,0
They use a penalized formulation instead of a constrained one.,,arg_fact,0
Consequently the regularization hyperparameters have to be set differently.,,arg_fact,0
The only new result seem to be Theorem 4.7 which is a natural extension to theorem 4.3 to zeroth-order methods.,,arg_evaluative,0
Comment:,,arg_structuring,0
- in the whole paper there is $y$ which is not defined.,,arg_evaluative,0
I guess it is the $y_{tar}$ fixed in the problem formulation Sec 3.2.,,arg_fact,0
In don't see why there is a need to work on any $y$. If it is true,,arg_evaluative,0
",  case assumption 4.5 do not make any sense since $y = y_{tar}$ (we just need to note $\|\nabla f(O,y_{tar})\| = C_g$) and some notation could be simplified setting for instance $f(x,y_{tar})  = f(x)$.",,arg_request,1
- In Theorem 4.7 an expectation on g(x_a) is missing,,arg_evaluative,0
Minor comments:,,arg_structuring,0
- Sec 3.1 theta_i -> x_i,,arg_request,1
"- Sec 3.3 the argmin is a set, then it is LMO $\in$ argmin.",,arg_evaluative,0
===== After rebuttal ======,,arg_structuring,0
The authors answered some of my questions but I still think it is a borderline submission.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors of this paper are proposing a neural network approach for learning diffusion dynamics in networks.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors argue that the main advantage of their framework is that it incorporates the structure of independent cascades into the model which predicts the diffusion process.,,arg_structuring,0
The primary difficulty in reviewing this paper is the poor presentation of the paper.,,arg_evaluative,0
"There are many typos and mistakes (e.g., the last paragraph of the paper starts with a sentence that does not make any sense), missing references (e.g., there is an empty parenthesis at the end of the second paragraph on the second page) and in at least two cases, there are references to a formula that is not in the manuscript (e.g., reference to formula 15 on line 3 of page 5).",,arg_evaluative,0
This issues makes reviewing this paper very difficult.,,arg_evaluative,0
"In the modeling section, authors use p(I|D) as q^D(.) in the Eq. 12, where p(I|D) is the conditional probability that a particular node infected an observed infected node first.",,arg_structuring,0
"Plugging p(I|D) in Eq. 12 and using decomposition of p(D ,I) used in Eq. 10, we arrive at a formulation which drops all p(I|D) terms.",,arg_structuring,0
"This results in an objective function which only involves infected nodes (and no term associated with the parent node), weighted by likelihood of each node j infecting the node at step i. This should make the training more simplified than what is discussed in Algorithm 2.",,arg_fact,0
"Beyond this simplification, I am not clear if that is actually intended by the authors.",,arg_request,1
The experiments demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed model compared to alternative benchmarks.,,arg_structuring,0
The authors explain how they trained their own model but there is no mention on how they trained benchmark models.,,arg_request,1
"However, given that the datasets used in the experiments were not used in the associated benchmark papers, it is necessary for authors to explain how they trained competing models.",,arg_request,1
"Due to several shortcomings of the paper, most important of which is on presentation of the paper, this manuscript requires a significant revision by the authors to reach the necessary standards for publication, moreover it would be helpful to clarify the modeling choices and consequences of these choices more clearly.",,arg_evaluative,0
The paper proposes a new method for robustifying a pre-trained model improving its decision boundaries.,,arg_structuring,0
The goal is to defend the model from mistakes in training labels and to be more robust to adversarial examples at test time.,,arg_structuring,0
"The main idea is to train a LDA on top of the last-layer, or many layers in its ensemble version, making use of a small set of clean labels after training the main model.",,arg_structuring,0
"Additionally, robustness to outliers is achieved by the minimum covariance determinant estimator for the LDA covariance matrix.",,arg_structuring,0
"While I find this idea interesting and of potential practical use, I have concerns about novelty and the experimental results and overall I recommend rejection.",,arg_evaluative,0
== Method,,arg_structuring,0
"At a high level, the idea of imposing a mixture of gaussian structure in the feature space of a deep neural network classifier is not new.",,arg_evaluative,0
"See for example [A, B].",,arg_structuring,0
"In particular, [B] performs experiments on adversarial examples.",,arg_fact,0
"Moreover, in spite of the authors writing that their goal is “completely different” from [Lee at al 18a, Ma et al 18a], I found the two cited papers having a similar intent and approach to the problem, but a comparison is completely missing.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Without a proper comparison (formal and experimental) with these lines of work, the paper is incomplete.",,arg_request,1
Theorem 1 well supports the proposed method and it is well explained. I did not check the proofs in appendix.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Regarding the presentation, I found odd having some experimental results (page 5) before the Section on experience even have started.",,arg_evaluative,0
== Experiments,,arg_structuring,0
The authors did not comment on the computational overhead of training their LDA.,,arg_evaluative,0
"But I assume it is very cheap compared to training e.g. the ResNet, correct?",,arg_request,1
"I also did not find an explanation of which version backward/forward losses [Patrini et al. 17] is used in the experiments: are the noise transition matrices estimated on the data or assumed to be known (for fair comparison, I would do the former).",,arg_request,1
I disagree on the importance of the numbers reported on the abstract: DenseNet on Cifar10 with 60% goes from 53.34 to 74.72.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This is the improvement with the weakest possible baseline, i.e. no method to defend for noise!",,arg_fact,0
"Looking at Table 3, which is on ResNets, I will make this point clear.",,arg_structuring,0
"Noise 60% on CIFAR10, DDGC improves 60.05-> 71.38, while (hard) bootstrap and forward do better.",,arg_fact,0
"Even more, it seems that forward does always better than DDGC with noise 60% on every dataset.",,arg_fact,0
"Therefore, I don’t find interesting to report how DDGC improve upon “no baseline”, because known methods do even better.",,arg_evaluative,0
"Yet, it is interesting --- and I find this to be a contribution of the paper --- that DDGC can be used in combination with prior work to boost performance even further.",,arg_evaluative,0
A missing empirical analysis is on class-conditional noise (see for example Patrini et al. 17 for a definition).,,arg_request,1
An additional column on the table showing that the algorithm can also work in this case would improve the confidence that the proposed method is useful in practice.,,arg_request,1
Uniform noise is the least realistic assumption for label noise.,,arg_fact,0
"Regarding the experiments on adversarial examples, I am not convinced of their relevance at all.",,arg_evaluative,0
There are now dozens of defence methods that work (partially) for improving robustness.,,arg_fact,0
I don’t think it is of any practical use to show that a new algorithm (such at DDGD) provide some defence compared to no defence.,,arg_evaluative,0
A proper baseline should have been compared.,,arg_request,1
"One more unclear but important point: is Table 3 obtained by white-box attacks on the Resnet/Denset but oblivious of the MCD? Is so, I don’t think such an experiment tells the whole story: as the the MCD would arguably also be deployed for classification, the attacker would also target it.",,arg_request,1
"Additionally, the authors state “we remark that accessing the parameters of the generative classifiers […] is not a mild assumption since the information about training data is required to compute them”.",,arg_structuring,0
"I don’t follow this argument: this is just part of the classifier. White box attacks are by definition performed with the knowledge of the model, what",,arg_request,1
is the difference here?,,none,0
Table 8 rises some concerns.,,arg_evaluative,0
"I appreciate the idea of testing full white-box adversarial attacks here. But I don’t understand how it is possible that DDGC is more robust, with higher adversarial test accuracy, than in Table 3.",,arg_evaluative,0
"[A] Wen, Yandong, et al. ""A discriminative feature learning approach for deep face recognition."" European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, Cham, 2016.",,arg_other,0
"[B] Wan, Weitao, et al. ""Rethinking feature distribution for loss functions in image classification."" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2018.",,arg_other,0
The authors propose a generative model of networks by learning embeddings and pairing the embeddings with a prior distribution over networks.,,arg_structuring,0
The idea is that the prior distribution may explain structure that the embeddings would not have to capture.,,arg_structuring,0
The motivation for doing this is that this structure is typically hard to model for network embeddings.,,arg_evaluative,0
The authors propose a clean -if improper- prior on networks and proceed to perform maximum likelihood inference on it.,,arg_evaluative,0
The experiments show that the approach works fine for link porediction and can be used for visualization.,,arg_evaluative,0
Two points:,,arg_structuring,0
a) Why not try to do this with Variational inference? It should conceptually still work and be fast and potentially more robust.,,arg_request,1
b) The prior seems to be picked according to properties of the observed data and expressed in a product of constraints.,,arg_evaluative,0
"This seems clunky, I would have been more impressed with a prior structure that ties in closer with the embeddings and requires less hand-engineering.",,arg_evaluative,0
A key point of interest is the following: very exciting recent work (GraphRNN: Generating Realistic Graphs with Deep Auto-regressive Models by You et al ICML2018) has proposed neural generative models of networks with a high degree of fidelity and much less hand-picked features.,,arg_evaluative,0
The work here tries to not learn a lot of these structures but impose them.,,arg_evaluative,0
Do the authors think that ultimately learning priors with models like GraphRNN might be more promising for certain applications?,,arg_request,1
"The drawback in this model here is that ultimately networks are embedded, but not really generated during test time.",,arg_evaluative,0
A more predictive generative model that makes less hard assumptions on graph data would be interesting.,,arg_request,1
Update After rebuttal:,,arg_structuring,0
"Given the authors' rebuttal to all reviews, I am upgrading my score to a 6.",,arg_fact,0
"I still feel that more learning (as inGraphRNN) to build a fuller generative model of the graph would be interesting, but the authors make a strong case for the usefulness and practicality of their approach.",,arg_other,0
This paper presents a new way to represent a dense matrix in a compact format.,,arg_structuring,0
"First, the method prunes a dense matrix based on the Viterbi-based pruning.",,arg_structuring,0
"Then, the pruned matrix is quantized with alternating multi-bit quantization.",,arg_structuring,0
"Finally, the binary vectors produced by the quantization algorithm are further compressed with the Viterbi-based algorithm.",,arg_structuring,0
It spots the problem of each existing approach and solve the problems by combining each method.,,arg_structuring,0
The combination is new and the result is encouraging.,,arg_evaluative,0
I find this paper is interesting and I like the strong results.,,arg_evaluative,0
It is an interesting combination of methods.,,arg_evaluative,0
"However, the experiments are not enough to show that the proposed method is really needed to achieve the results. If these are answered well, I'd be happy to change my evaluation.",,arg_request,1
1. The method should be compared with other combinations of components.,,arg_request,1
"At least, it should be compared with ""Multi-bit quantization only (Xu et al., 2018)"" and ""Multi-bit-quantization + Viterbi-based binary code encoding"".",,arg_request,1
"2. The experiments with ""Don't Care"" should go to the experiment section, and the end-to-end results should be present but not the ratio of incorrect bits.",,arg_request,1
"3. Similarly, the paper will become stronger if it has some experimental results that compare quantization methods.",,arg_request,1
In Section 3.3.,,arg_fact,0
", it mentions that the conventional k-bit quantization was tried and significant accuracy drops were observed.",,none,0
I feel that this is a kind of things which support the proposed method if it is properly assessed.,,arg_fact,0
"4. When you say ""slow"" form something and propose a method to address it, I'd like to see some benchmark numbers. There is an experiment with simulation, but that does not seem to simulate the slow ""sequential sparse matrix decoding process"".",,arg_fact,0
Minor comments:,,arg_structuring,0
* It was a bit hard to understand how a matrix is processed through the flowchart in Fig. 1 at first glance.,,arg_request,1
It would help readers to understand it better if it has a corresponding figure which shows how a matrix is processed through the flowchart.,,arg_request,1
"This paper proposes a method for mathematical problem embedding, which firstly decomposes problems into concepts by an abstraction step and then trains a skip-gram model to learn concept embedding.",,arg_structuring,0
A problem can be represented as the average concept (corresponding to those in the problem) embeddings.,,arg_structuring,0
"To handle the imbalanced dataset, a negative pre-training method is proposed to decrease false and false positives.",,arg_structuring,0
"Experimental results show that the proposed method works much better than baselines in similar problem detection, on an undergraduate probability data set.",,arg_structuring,0
Strong points:,,arg_structuring,0
(1)	The idea of decomposing problems into concepts is interesting and also makes sense.,,arg_evaluative,0
(2),,arg_evaluative,0
The training method for imbalanced datasets is impressive.,,none,0
Concerns or suggestions:,,arg_structuring,0
1.	The main idea of using contents to represent a problem is quite simple and straightforward.,,arg_fact,0
The contribution of this paper seems more on the training method for imbalanced data sets.,,arg_fact,0
But there are no comparisons between the proposed training method and previous related works.,,arg_evaluative,0
"Actually, imbalance data sets are common in machine learning problems and there are many related works.",,arg_fact,0
The comparisons are also absent in experiments.,,arg_evaluative,0
"2.	The experimental data set is too small, with only 635 problems.",,arg_evaluative,0
It is difficult to judge the performance of the proposed model based on so small data set.,,arg_evaluative,0
"3.	The proposed method, which decomposes a problem into multiple concepts, looks general for many problem settings.",,arg_fact,0
"For example, representing a movie or news article by tags or topics.",,arg_fact,0
"In this way, the proposed method can be tested in a broader domain and on larger datasets.",,arg_fact,0
"4.	For the final purpose, comparing problem similarity, I am wondering what the result will be if we train a supervised model based problem-problem similarity labels?",,arg_request,1
