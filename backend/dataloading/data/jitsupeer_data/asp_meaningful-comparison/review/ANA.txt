It also adds capacity and it is not at all made clear whether the comparison is fair since no analysis on number of parameters are shown.
1. Even though K-matrices are aimed at structured matrices, it would be curious either to empirically compare K-matrices to linear transformations in fully-connected networks (i.e. dense matrices) or to provide some theoretical analysis.
