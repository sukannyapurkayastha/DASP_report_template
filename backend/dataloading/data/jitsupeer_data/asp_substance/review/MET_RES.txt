First, In Theorem 2, which seems to be a main result of the paper, the authors were concerned with the condition when W_{ji} >0, but there is not conclusion if W_{ji} =0.
Even with no data augmentation, and even with the original networks, membership can only be assessed with a 90% accuracy.
2. As to the results of the Pose2Pose network, I wonder if there are some artifacts that will affect the performance of the Pose2Frame network.
However, this only affects the method of drawing the samples from a fixed known distribution and should have no more effect on the results than say a choice of a pseudo-random number generator.
On the other hand, the obtained results are very weak: only one layered version of the paper is analysed and the theorem applies only to networks with less than some threshold of parameters.
Overall, while I find the proposed approach simple -- the paper needs to address some issues regarding the claims made and should provide more quantitative experimental results justifying the same.
This shows itself in the results; i.e., the proposed algorithm is either negligibly performing better than GBDT or when  GBDT dependence removed, it performs worse. It seems to me
Results and discussion about how the previous methods with full features perform compared to SASNet, and also how we can include those features into SASNet should complete the paper.
2. Section 3.3 argues that K-matrices allow to obtain an improvement of inference speed, however, providing the results of convergence speed (e.g. training plots with a number of epochs) will allow a better understanding of the proposed approach and will improve the quality of the paper.
Though promising results have been demonstrated, a drawback of the proposed method is that it introduces more memory overhead compared to GPipe.
Even with the hybrid method, the accuracy still drops.
