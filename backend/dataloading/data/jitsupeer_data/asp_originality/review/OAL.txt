However, the paper contains only little novelty and does not provide sufficiently new scientific insights.
Originality: The work is moderately original.
But I'm concerned with the novelty and contributions of this paper.
In summary, the quality of the paper is poor and the originality of the work is low.
Overall, this paper is good, but is not novel or important enough for acceptance.
Overall, I think this paper is not good enough for an ICLR paper and the presentation is confusing in both its contributions and its technical novelty.
I believe the primary claim of this paper is neither surprising nor novel.
Assessment: Overall, this is a borderline paper, as the task is interesting and novel, but the presentation is lacking in technical detail and there is a lack of novelty on the modeling side.
The only issue with this paper is its degree of novelty, which is narrow.
Hence, I am not very sure whether the novelty of the paper is significant.
Overall, this appears to be a board-line paper with weak novelty.
This was a fun, albeit incremental paper.
The paper is overall well written and intuitive but limited in evaluation and novelty (see e.g. [1,2] ) with only limited modifications (sharing low-level controller) for the multi agent case.
My main concern comes from the novelty of this paper.
