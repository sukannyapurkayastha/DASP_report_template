Based on the summary, cons, and pros, the current rating I am giving now is weak reject. I would like to discuss the final rating with other reviewers, ACs.
In summary, I'm inclined to reject this paper given the current version.
There are a few grammatical/spelling errors that need ironing out.
I believe that the paper should currently be rejected, but I encourage the authors to revise the paper.
There are several weaknesses in this paper.
Nevertheless, I believe that it still has to address some points in order to be better suited for publication:
I vote for rejection for four major weaknesses explained as follows.
4) There are several typos/grammar issues e.g. "believed to occurs", "important parameters sections", "capacity that if efficiently allocated", etc.).
- The paper is over the hard page limit for ICLR so needs to be edit to reduce the length.
I vote to reject the paper at this stage, mainly because of the following three points:
The paper would need to be improved substantially in order to appear at a conference like ICLR.
I do not think this work is ready for publication.
I think the paper does not fit this conference. It is better to be presented in a Demonstration section at a *ACL conference.
Overall, I feel that this paper falls short of what it promises, so I cannot recommend acceptance at this time.
* The paper is almost 9 pages long, but the contribution does not appear more substantial than a standard 8-page submission.
