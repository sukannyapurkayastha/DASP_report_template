As pointed out by R2, with depth there are a lot more number of possible ways in which one could carve out decision boundaries to separate data points, thus, it is not clear that the loose linear upper bound holds Specifically, as one might expect with depth it could be possible that linear capacity increase is a lower bound (I am not suggesting that it is, but that possibility should be considered and explained in the paper).
