This is discussed on p4, but it's unclear to me how keeping $\sigma$ separate is benefitial for the analysis, and this is not picked up again explicitly again?
this analysis is not currently included in the main body of the manuscript, but rather in the appendix, which I find rather annoying.
The paper offers some analysis, suggesting when each of the conditions occurs, upper bounds the smallest singular value of D A (where the example dependent diagonal matrix D incorporates the ReLU activation (shouldnâ€™t this be more clearly introduced and notated?).
