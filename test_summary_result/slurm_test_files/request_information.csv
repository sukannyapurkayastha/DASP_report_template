Explanation,1.0,"[['Reviewer 39tB', ['2. It seems that the setting is closely related to low switching RL and RL with delayed feedback. It will be interesting if the authors could briefly discuss about the connections.']], ['Reviewer 56ui', ['How is an agent chosen to be activated in Line 5 of both Algorithm 1 and 2?', 'What is the oracle to compute the bonus term?', 'What are the terms $\\tilde{\\beta}_1$ and $\\tilde{\\beta}_2$?']], ['Reviewer HvUo', ['As far as I know, MARL often adopts the Centralized Training Decentralized Execution(CTDE) framework to avoid the action space growing exponentially with the number of users. However, it is unclear whether the proposed scenario follows ""decentralized execution"". Agents are supposed to execute based on partial observations in a decentralized manner, but the proposed approach appears to involve a central server consistently during execution. If the proposed scenario is inconsistent with CTDE, I would be interested to hear from the authors what the distinct advantages or necessity of this scenario is.', 'A simple question: Why is the order of the Eluder dimension of regret reported as $O(\\sqrt{\\text{dim}_E})$ instead of $O(\\text{dim}_E)$? The regret in Line 677 shows similar results to numerous other papers, but is written in $\\sqrt{O(\\text{dim}_E)}$ despite the fact that $O(\\text{dim}_E)$ dominates. For the linear MDP case, [1] presents a lower bound of $\\Omega(dH\\sqrt{T})$, and considering $\\text{dim}_E = \\tilde{O}(d)$, the reported results seem lower than the known lower bound. Many papers report similar results as the authors, but am I missing something?']], ['Reviewer ijz1', ['What is the meaning of ""fully asynchronous"" in table 1?']]]"
Improvement,0.75,"[['Reviewer 39tB', ['1. It seems that part of the techniques is from previous results, such as the bonus function oracle. It will be helpful if there is a section discussing technical novelty.', '3. For the communication complexity bound in theorem 5.1, should it be $/\\alpha$ instead of $\\alpha$? In addition, why not choose $\\alpha=1/M$ in both theorems? In this way, the communication cost can be improved. (Please correct me if I misunderstood anything) 4. Line ?? in line 214 of page 6. Please correct it.']], ['Reviewer HvUo', ['Theorem 5.1: Total communication complexity should be fixed to $O((1+M\\alpha)^2 / \\alpha)$.']], ['Reviewer ijz1', ['I think the major concern is non-optimal complexity bounds. Although it seems unreasonable to ask for a matching upper\\&lower regret bound for the contextual bandit problem, the part about RL could be possibly improved (at least, the dependence on $H$ is not tight). Also I am curious that what is the current best lower bound for the communication cost to reach an $\\sqrt{T}$ regret bound. It would be an interesting problem to study the exact trade-off between the communication cost and regret.', 'A minor concern might be about the technical novelty given previous methods on measuring the uncertainty.']]]"
