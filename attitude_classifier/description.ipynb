While the experiments on ShapeNet is common in the community and shows good result, I am in general doubtful whether such an approach could be really applied to the real world., In motivation, the authors talk about usage in vision, graphics, and robotics.

The authors do not have experiments or discussions in such cases., It would be nice if the authors could conduct a minimal set of experiments in the real-world setup (e.g., extract a reconstruction from a ScanNet model and attempt to apply keypoint/semantic part transfer).

The authors do not have experiments or discussions in such cases., It would be nice if the authors could conduct a minimal set of experiments in the real-world setup (e.g., extract a reconstruction from a ScanNet model and attempt to apply keypoint/semantic part transfer).

Some recent methods, e.g., [1], should also be included. Otherwise the results are not convincing at all (only compared to a single baseline which was proposed years ago). And it seems CPAE is the only baseline method for all the experiments. More baselines are required on both tasks.]]]  "
