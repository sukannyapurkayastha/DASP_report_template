Experiment,1.0,"[['Reviewer DtE5', ['The predictions depend on noise level. Is this something that can be tested experimentally using firing rate variability?']], ['Reviewer V9KM', ['“We postulate that selective inhibition along the hippocampus will lead to different types of memory impairment for spatial tasks”. How would be possible to test this hypothesis experimentally? The authors mention “performing confusion experiments” but it would be interesting to better discuss how such experiments would look like.']]]"
Improvement,1.0,"[['Reviewer DtE5', [""The authors propose selective inhibition experiments to test these predictions. In fact, such experiments have been done, and unfortunately they don't consistently support the predictions (none of the studies mentioned below are cited in the paper). The model would make more sense in light of at least some of these studies if the dorsal/ventral division of labor was reversed from what the authors proposed, consistent with the electrophysiology data. The review by Fanselow & Dong (2010, Neuron) provides a more systematic discussion of studies dissociating dorsal and ventral subregions."", 'Can the authors do a better job relating their work to existing literature (see Weaknesses)? I understand that due to space limitations it is unlikely that they will be able to comprehensively address this literature, but I want to make sure that the work is at least largely in alignment with what is known.']], ['Reviewer V9KM', ['Please always explicitly describe the variables used in equations (also in figure captions).', '“To determine whether two contexts manifolds are separable, we use a strict criterion: the two manifolds are separable if and only if they do not have any intersections.”. This requirement seems quite strong, because it assumes that we need to decode context from any position in the manifold… Could it be replaced by a smoother criterion and/or by some form of probabilistic (linear) discriminability?', 'Please always explicitly state where the information can be found in the Supplemental material.']]]"
Typo Fix,0.5,"[['Reviewer DtE5', ['Minor: - ""hippocampus"" is inconsistently upper-case/lower-case.
