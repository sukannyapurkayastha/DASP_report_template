Improvement,1.0,"[['Reviewer CrUb', ['Related Work. At this point, the topic this paper is focused on has a rather rich literature and I think a more detailed related work is warranted (perhaps in the appendix if space is an issue). For example, the results by Kirsch et al. (which is cited) are very similar to what authors show, especially results on scaling effects. The main different is width scaling in that paper and no geometric analysis, but nonetheless the relationship warranted more emphasis and discussion. Similarly, several recent works have explored OOD generalization of toy ICL tasks defined in prior works (e.g., see Ahuja and Lopez-Paz [1] for work on linear regression tasks and Ramesh et al. [2] for group arithmetic tasks). Regarding grokking, there are several works exploring the phase transition-y nature of this task. For example, see Kumar et al. [3]. The transient nature of ICL also has negative results (see Reddy [4]), which are worth discussion since they are the primary conclusion in depth scaling as I see it.']], ['Reviewer Jerg', ['The definition of task diversity is not well defined. Is the number of pretraining tasks truly indicative of task diversity? I think the paper could benefit from some justification of this assumption.', 'Many works in the continual learning and meta learning literature suggest that training on multiple tasks at once leads to better generalization. Perhaps it is worth including brief discussion on the connections between this point and the model’s ability to generalize ood which is predominantly determined by the number of pre-training tasks.', 'Since multiplication can be viewed as repeated addition, isn’t skill 2 an extension of skill 3 (or can even be viewed as skill 3 composed with itself multiple times)? Is hierarchy of skills important here?']], ['Reviewer PjEW', ['I am left wondering if this batch construction methodology, as a further departure from the standard language modelling setting, has any other implications for the learning process that may affect the generality of the results.', 'However, I feel that this section could be improved if the authors attempted to offer greater insight into the relationship between these prior works and the present work. For example, the authors have an opportunity here to informally describe the in-context linear regression and the modular addition problem settings that the newly proposed setting generalises.', ""2. In the figure 1 caption, is it possible to offer a clearer summary of the difference between in-distribution generalisation and out-of-distribution memorisation? On my first read through, treating the figure and caption as an overview of the work's main results, I had trouble distinguishing these two concepts.""]], ['Reviewer rwBm', ['The skill decomposition discussed in section 5 is great. The clear pattern in attention heads verifies it very well. (The hypotheses could be further verified if the author can link the values of $c_1, c_2$ to some weights in the network, see the question part.)', 'The emergent ability (or grokking) usually refers to a phenomenon in the model “got stuck” in a non-generalization region and suddenly gained the generalization ability. Hence some discussion about the learning dynamics, i.e., how the accuracy, loss, representation, ability, attention pattern, etc., gradually evolve during training would make the paper stronger.', 'The task and batch sample selection in this paper have many constraints (e.g., the rectangular rule, the balanced number of samples in each batch, etc.). However, the practical systems usually cannot strictly satisfy all these assumptions. Hence a more detailed analysis of how these assumptions influence the generalization ability would provide more insights to practical systems.', 'The paper claims in line 147 that “As the o.o.d. performance increases, the pre-training performance simultaneously degrades “. However, it is hard to read this information from Figure 3-a panel 1. Maybe a different color mapping or adding numbers on these patches would be helpful.']]]"
Explanation,0.75,"[['Reviewer CrUb', [""PCA variance. Given this is a rather rich geometry in 2-D, I'm slightly surprised to see PCA captured it. Did you have to do some preprocessing? How much variance is explained by the two projected components? If there are other components that are not shown but have a large variance, what do those components encode---can you try 3D plots?""]], ['Reviewer PjEW', [""1. Why is the title 'learning to grok'? Is this meant in the sense that the grokking of a modular addition task is occurring in-context? If so, this seems a little inaccurate, since the phenomenon analogous to 'grokking' seems to still be occurring during pre-training.""]], ['Reviewer rwBm', ['Equation 2 is a bit hard to understand. How does it correlate to $z = ax+by$ ? (Although, from the latter explanations, I know the model relies on $c_1z_1^t + c_2z_2^t$ to get $z$, but it might be helpful to claim how it is derived.) - Better to define $GF(p)$, i.e., the Galois field, before using it.', 'The OOD settings studied in grokking or emergent ability setting are quite related to the compositional generalization and systematic generalization. It would be helpful to discuss them in the related works, here are some of them: [1] Schott, Lukas, et al. ""Visual representation learning does not generalize strongly within the same domain.""

Experiment,0.5,"[['Reviewer CrUb', ['What does the MLP do? Given the mechinterp focused on attention solely, it is unclear what role MLPs played. Two experiments to try here are: (i) train attention only models to see if MLPs are even necessary, and (ii) perform the PCA analysis to uncover representations\' geometry at the level of attentions and MLPs at each block in the model. Experiment (i) may require retraining models, so I understand if the authors are unable to conduct it, but my expectation will be that you will see that model ""internalizes"" task vectors and records them in MLPs. Attention only models can solve the task, but I expect the representations\' geometry will be quite different. For experiment (ii) however, I expect that\'s easy to run and is merely repeating the plotting script on intermediate representations as a forward pass occurs through the model. If the geometry is primarily formed at attention layers, we\'ll see that in this experiment. vice versa, if it forms via MLPs, we\'ll see it explicitly.']], ['Reviewer rwBm', ['As also mentioned in the strength part, is it possible to find some specific value in the weight space (e.g., attention weights, readout layers, etc.) that is highly correlated to $c_1, c_2$? If so, the hypothesis that the model first learns skill 2 (scale each example) and then skill 3 (weighted combine different examples) would be further verified.']]]"
Result,0.25,"[['Reviewer rwBm', ['Are the results in Figure 6 coming from $d=2$ or $d=4$? I can find the figure for all 8 attention heads for $d=2$ in the appendix, what about the $d=4$ case? It might be helpful to see if the pattern in later layers (i.e., attention focusing on different $z_i$) exists in shallow layers, and vice versa.']]]"
Typo Fix,0.25,"[['Reviewer PjEW', ['It seems that equation 2 should read $\\ldots = (z_1^t, z_2^2) \\mod p$ and the equation on line 203 should read $c_1x + c_2y \\mod p$. That is, $x$ and $y$ should swap places with $z_1^t$ and $z_2^t$. Is this indeed a mistake, or am I missing something?', 'In figure 6 (top row) there is a typo: ""Qeury"" on the vertical axis.']]]"
