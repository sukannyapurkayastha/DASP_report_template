Substance(MET),0.75,Incomplete details on perfromance of the method,"[['Reviewer 1HkZ', ['1. How do you confirm the prompt is reliable and the output of the GenAI is following the rules?']], ['Reviewer ZAnW', [""While the author presents a comprehensive theoretical framework and provides clear and detailed insights into the prompt strategies, there is room for improvement in the experimental validation of the proposed techniques. As outlined in the paper, the experiments are limited to a single product tested on a sample of 236 participants. Given the potential applicability of this technique to a wide range of products, the scope of experimentation appears somewhat narrow. Expanding the experiment set to encompass a more diverse array of products would strengthen the paper's claims."", ""Additionally, the manual design of prompts by the author may not be a scalable solution when considering the need for ad design across a vast array of products. Further exploration of automated or semi-automated prompt generation methods could enhance the paper's practicality and applicability in real-world scenarios."", '1. Have you explored the possibility of automating the prompt generation process for various products?', '2. Could you provide insights into any supplementary experiments conducted to further validate the effectiveness of the prompt strategy outlined in your paper?']], ['Reviewer DN2b', ['Also, the paper does not explain how the envisioned framework will be applied in practice. The paper’s evaluation defines a set of prompts that are very specific to the products that are studied and generates creatives that are then subsequently used to compare the user perceptions vs. ad creatives that simply show the product with a white background. Overall, it’s unclear on whether the envisioned framework can be applied in practice without great input and effort from experts that will guide the generation of the ad creatives.', 'In addition, there is a disconnection between the motivation of the work and the framework/evaluation. The framework does not account for user personalization, which is an important aspect when considering the ad ecosystem.

How did you recruit participants, and why most of them are from India? How can the recruitment approach affect the presented results?', '2. How are the two products selected? Are these products popular in India, where most participants are from?', '3.

Originality(MET),0.5,Limited novelty in theoretical contribution,"[['Reviewer 1HkZ', ['Additionally, the paper fails to explain how this study is different from previous efforts that aim to understand the use of neuromarketing methods without the use of Generative AI to create the ad creatives. The presented framework can also be applied by people to generate ad creatives, so its unclear if the novelty of this work lies in the formulation/use of the framework or the combination of the framework with Generative AI models like ChatGPT. I suggest to the authors to better contextualize their work and better explain the novelty of this work.']], ['Reviewer ZAnW', ['3. The method mentioned in the paper, which utilizes ChatGTP to generate accurate prompts and generates high-quality digital advertisements using this prompts and a large text-to-image model, has been widely applied in the engineering field and therefore lacks innovation.']]]"
Motivation-impact(MET),0.5,Limited insights based on design choices,"[['Reviewer 1HkZ', ['Thanks for your interests in ICLR! Overall, this is an interesting paper on a topic which is of interest to ICLR Conference. It offers valuable insights into the application of neuroscientifically designed content to enhance ad click-through rates. The paper astutely recognizes the promise of leveraging Generative AI for this purpose. Building upon this foundation, the author thoughtfully presents four distinct prompt strategies and supports them with well-structured experiments, thus substantiating the validity of their approach.']], ['Reviewer ZAnW', ['The paper does a good job of motivating and explaining the problem, as well as providing all the necessary details and motivation to understand the necessary background. Also, the paper focuses on an interesting aspect of generative AI and how it can be used to generate ad creatives with the goal of increasing click-through rates that, over the years, have been declining. Overall, I think that this work has the potential to inform various interested stakeholders, including advertisers, policymakers, and social media operators. Also, I like the paper’s approach that aims to leverage the power of Generative AI (particularly ChatGPT) to generate content based on principles obtained from the neuroscience field.']]]"

There are a couple of references listed as Anonymous, when they are not Anonymous so I suggest fixing these issues.']]]"
Clarity(MET),0.25,Unclear description of method,"[['Reviewer 1HkZ', ['1. This work is too simple, just using the existing GenAI to produce the context and comparing it with the corresponding items.', '2. The prompt is hand-crafted, and cannot be applied flexibly.']]]"
