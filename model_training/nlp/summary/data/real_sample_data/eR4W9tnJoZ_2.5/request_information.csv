Improvement,1.0,"[['Reviewer 1HkZ', ['3. The number of samples in the experiment is too small, and the experiments should cover more scenarios.', ""2. Since it's an online experiment, why not invite more people?""]], ['Reviewer Bg7M', [""While the author presents a comprehensive theoretical framework and provides clear and detailed insights into the prompt strategies, there is room for improvement in the experimental validation of the proposed techniques. As outlined in the paper, the experiments are limited to a single product tested on a sample of 236 participants. Given the potential applicability of this technique to a wide range of products, the scope of experimentation appears somewhat narrow. Expanding the experiment set to encompass a more diverse array of products would strengthen the paper's claims."", ""Additionally, the manual design of prompts by the author may not be a scalable solution when considering the need for ad design across a vast array of products. Further exploration of automated or semi-automated prompt generation methods could enhance the paper's practicality and applicability in real-world scenarios."", '1. Have you explored the possibility of automating the prompt generation process for various products?']], ['Reviewer DN2b', ['Additionally, the paper fails to explain how this study is different from previous efforts that aim to understand the use of neuromarketing methods without the use of Generative AI to create the ad creatives. The presented framework can also be applied by people to generate ad creatives, so its unclear if the novelty of this work lies in the formulation/use of the framework or the combination of the framework with Generative AI models like ChatGPT. I suggest to the authors to better contextualize their work and better explain the novelty of this work.', 'In addition, there is a disconnection between the motivation of the work and the framework/evaluation. The framework does not account for user personalization, which is an important aspect when considering the ad ecosystem. So I am wondering how the paper is planning to incorporate user personalization in this framework and how Generative AI models can assist in this, especially when considering the privacy concerns that may arise from sharing user-specific data with companies that offer LLM solutions (e.g., OpenAI).', '2. Consider not using pie charts for the evaluation results, given that it is one of the worst visualization methods.']]]"
