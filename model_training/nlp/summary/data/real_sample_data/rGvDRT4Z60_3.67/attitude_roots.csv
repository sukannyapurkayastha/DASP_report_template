Substance(MET),1.0,Incomplete details on perfromance of the method,"[['Reviewer Mex5', ['+ The points of intervention discussions give a nice overview of the PATE approach and ways in which additional mechanisms can be independently injected. Note, however, the independent intervention assumption is a weakness below.', 'Handling rejection in experiments will also need to be done but unsure what the best approach there would be. Perhaps a random human decision maker?', 'Suggestion: either integrate suggestion regarding accounting for rejection above, or incorporate some form of rejection (or simulate it) in the existing methods being compared to. It may be that the best methodology is not FairPATE but some existing baselines if adjusted to include fairness rejection option.', 'Question A: Is reasonable to ignore downstream decisions from queries rejected due to fairness (i.e. contrary to my suggestion in the weaknesses above)?', ""Question B: C1 makes a point that adding privacy after fairness may break fairness. What about in expectation? Were one to view the demographic statistics defining fairness measures in expectations, wouldn't they remain fair?""]], ['Reviewer Mex5', ['How does the framework work in case of some distribution shift? This is especially important in the context of my question above.', 'Fig. 2 and 3 use orange colors for two different algorithms (Tran et al (Fig 2) and Jagielski et al. (Fig 3)). The authors should report all algorithms in all figures or justify their absence.']], ['Reviewer XkhF', ['3. __W3__ Abstaining from prediction for fairness reasons The introduction justifies this as _""if a decision cannot be made without violating a pre-specified fairness metric, then the model can refuse to answer at which point the decision can be relegated to a human judge""_. If I have understood this correctly, this is a flawed argument. For example, consider the situation where there are group of data points from the majority group, on which if the algorithm predicts correctly the fairness will be violated and hence the algorithm abstains. Nevertheless, the prediction is easy for this group and the judge nevertheless predicts on them correctly and the overall fairness is still violated. Isn\'t this pointless then to relegate this to the judge ? Intuitively, it appears that any problem can be made fair this way by simply refusing to predict on certain majority groups thereby artificially boosting the fairness of the algorithm. The correct fairness solution should aim to improve performance on the minority group instead. 4. __W4__ Unfair Comparisons Fair-PATE and Loewy et. al\'s algorithm do not work under the same restrictions of differential privacy. Specifically, Fair-PATE uses public unlabelled data and Loewy et. al doesn\'t and we know that (even a small amount of) public data can severely help in improving accuracy of DP models (perhaps fairness too). Hence, it appears to me that Loewy et. al. uses a significantly stricter notion of privacy and achieves nearly comparable result and in some cases even better (for tabular datasets, there are no comparison on vision datasets with Loewy et. al.).', 'Motivation I understand that there are several works showing that privacy incurs a sacrifice in fairness. However, one possible approach to this problem is simply improving the accuracy and perhaps the resultant accuracy also leads to high fairness. In fact Berrada et. al. (2023) makes this argument with some experiments in their paper. I did not see an argument in this paper why this approach is not expected to solve all problems. Why should there be a trade-off between privacy and fairness ? Is it known in the literature and are there theoretical studies arguing about the necessity of a trade-off ? Missing baselines Why is there no comparison with the algorithm of Zhang et. al. (2021), Kulynuych et. al. (2022) and Berrada et. al. (2023) ?

However, there is also the consideration of intervention points 1,2,3 which seem odd as they points seen before any individual for whom fairness is considered is seen. That is, fairness about public individuals cannot be made there, independent of any other issues such as privacy budgeting. Further, Theorem 1 discusses a demographic parity pre-processor which achieves demographic parity on private data which I presume is irrelevant.', 'The statement ""DP that only protects privacy of a given sensitive feature"" might be mischaracterizing DP.
