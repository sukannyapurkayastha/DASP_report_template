Explanation,0.75,"[['Reviewer 2yrv', ['Are the limitations related to the cap of two-collider paths only? Are there any issues related to computational complexity? This was partially referenced in the attached form.', 'What was the reason of choosing only three models for benchmarks? It is unclear the actual advantage of such approach w.r.t. the existing FCI algorithm.', 'Why keeping the sample size range fixed even if the number of possible states increases dramatically? Observing 100 samples for BARLEY means that (ideally) each algorithm observe less than 1% of the state space, which limits the experimental evidence.']], ['Reviewer NFNu', ['1) What is the main Novelty of Theorem 1 compared to [14]? Can the theoretical motivation for the proposed search-and-score algorithm be deduced from the results in [14]?', '2) Do you have convergence guarantees for the algorithm? In other words, how many edge orientations need to be probed before convergence in step 1? How many loops over nodes and edges are needed until convergence?']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['3. One important thing that the readers may wonder is, what is the performance difference between the method based on approximate local scores limited to the closed surrounding vertices and the method with exact scores. Could the authors present more clues?']]]"
Experiment,0.25,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['4) Is there any class of distributions or graphs for which algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a true hidden causal graph?', '5) Did you perform any experiment to understand how sensitive is the proposed algorithm to the noise?', '6) In the first step of the algorithm does it matter in which order vertices are processed? do you select any specific order?']]]"
