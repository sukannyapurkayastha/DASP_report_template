Substance(MET),1.0,Incomplete details on perfromance of the method,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['Are the limitations related to the cap of two-collider paths only? Are there any issues related to computational complexity? This was partially referenced in the attached form.', 'What was the reason of choosing only three models for benchmarks? It is unclear the actual advantage of such approach w.r.t. the existing FCI algorithm.']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['1) What is the main Novelty of Theorem 1 compared to [14]? Can the theoretical motivation for the proposed search-and-score algorithm be deduced from the results in [14]?', '2) Do you have convergence guarantees for the algorithm? In other words, how many edge orientations need to be probed before convergence in step 1? How many loops over nodes and edges are needed until convergence?', '4) Is there any class of distributions or graphs for which algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a true hidden causal graph?', '5) Did you perform any experiment to understand how sensitive is the proposed algorithm to the noise?', '6) In the first step of the algorithm does it matter in which order vertices are processed? do you select any specific order?']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['2. I am curious about how to find ac-connected subset, and what the computational complexity is.', '3. One important thing that the readers may wonder is, what is the performance difference between the method based on approximate local scores limited to the closed surrounding vertices and the method with exact scores. Could the authors present more clues?']], ['Reviewer NFNu', ['The likelihood decomposition (Theorem 1) is nice and there seems to be a slight improvement in the empirical testing.', 'Then in the simulation studies, relevant methods from the references are excluded, even though the greedy search approaches (like references 13 and 32 for example) are not exact, but also heuristic. These (and similar) would need to be included in the benchmarking to judge the importance of the work.']]]"
Originality(MET),0.75,Limited novelty in theoretical contribution,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['The paper proposes a new empirical algorithm for causal structure discovery in ancestral graphs.

Clarity(MET),0.5,Unclear description of method,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['I also think that it will be beneficial to the reader if the connection between the theoretical results in Theorem 1 and the proposed algorithm are explained a bit more deeply with a more clear connection of how that theorem is being used.']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['1.

Soundness-correctness(MET),0.5,Correctness of algorithm proposed is questionable,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['The performance of the proposed solution is poor. For instance, Figure 2 most of the metrics overlap with existing solutions.']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['The proposed algorithm seems to be only empirical and lacks theoretical guarantees and relies on MIIC as a base of the algorithm. To my understanding, the paper does not provide a guarantee that the algorithm always converges in a reasonable number of steps (even if not to a global minimum). Multivariate cross-information over a large set of variables may be very sensitive to noise, which I think is a weakness compared to algorithms that use cross-information only over small number of (e.g. triples) of variables.']]]"
Substance(EXP),0.5,Experimental study not strong enough,"[['Reviewer NFNu', ['Why keeping the sample size range fixed even if the number of possible states increases dramatically? Observing 100 samples for BARLEY means that (ideally) each algorithm observe less than 1% of the state space, which limits the experimental evidence.']], ['Reviewer Rzut', ['5) Did you perform any experiment to understand how sensitive is the proposed algorithm to the noise?']]]"
