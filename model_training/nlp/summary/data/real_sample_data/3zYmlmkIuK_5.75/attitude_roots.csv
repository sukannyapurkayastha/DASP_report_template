However, it is unclear whether the proposed scenario follows ""decentralized execution"". Agents are supposed to execute based on partial observations in a decentralized manner, but the proposed approach appears to involve a central server consistently during execution. If the proposed scenario is inconsistent with CTDE, I would be interested to hear from the authors what the distinct advantages or necessity of this scenario is.']], ['Reviewer 56ui', ['I think the major concern is non-optimal complexity bounds. Although it seems unreasonable to ask for a matching upper\\&lower regret bound for the contextual bandit problem, the part about RL could be possibly improved (at least, the dependence on $H$ is not tight). Also I am curious that what is the current best lower bound for the communication cost to reach an $\\sqrt{T}$ regret bound. It would be an interesting problem to study the exact trade-off between the communication cost and regret.']]]"
