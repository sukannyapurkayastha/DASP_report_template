The tasks are explicitly designed to exploit these additional parameters - so framing the synthetic experiments as, "here are some simple functions for which we would need the additional parameters that we define" makes sense; but arguing that Hartford et al. "fail approximating rather simple functions" (page 7) is misleading because the functions are precisely the functions on which you would expect Hartford et al. to fail (because it's designed for a different setting).

With this dataset, it's a bit of a stretch to say there was "only a 1 point drop in BLEU score". That's a significant drop, and in fact the DynamicConv paper goes to significant lengths to make a smaller 0.8 point improvement.
