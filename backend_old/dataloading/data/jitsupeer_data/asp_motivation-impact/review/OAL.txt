Significance: It is hard to assess given the current submission.
In sum, the paper has a very good application but not good enough as a research paper.
Due to several shortcomings of the paper, most important of which is on presentation of the paper, this manuscript requires a significant revision by the authors to reach the necessary standards for publication, moreover it would be helpful to clarify the modeling choices and consequences of these choices more clearly.
While sensible, this seems to me to be too minor a contribution to stand alone as a paper.
This could have made the paper much stronger.
As such the paper is not convincing.
Overall, I am not sure what we could gain from this research direction.
1) The motivation is unclear and overall structure of the paper is confusing.
- Contribution overall may be a bit limited
Significance: Below average
The writing is understandable for the most part, but the paper seems to lack focus - there is no clear take home message.
