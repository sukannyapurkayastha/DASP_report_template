## **2. Components**

### **2.1 `backend`**

The backend is responsible for data collection from OpenReview, preprocessing the data, and managing the workflow between the models and the frontend. It sends preprocessed data to the models for processing, retrieves the results, and communicates the processed data to the frontend for further use.
