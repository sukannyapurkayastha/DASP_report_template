I am not familiar enough with the related literature to evaluate the originality of the approach, but from my understanding the analyses are well-conducted and well-motivated. The paper is written in a clear way.', 'The main issue with this submission, according to my non-expert opinion, is that it might have a limited relevance (and impact) on the NeurIPS community. Indeed, although I am aware that NeurIPS welcomes contributions more focused on neuroscientific aspects of neuronal computation, there is not a single NeurIPS paper cited in the literature, suggesting that this type of work might be more appropriate for other venues.']]]"

Substance(RWK),0.3333333333333333,Limited improvement over baselines,"[['Reviewer DtE5', [""Overall my critical comments are relatively minor (see below). I do have one major comment pertaining to the model's empirical predictions. The paper makes an interesting and testable prediction that the more widely tuned cells in the dorsal hippocampus are specialized for context discrimination, whereas the more narrowly tuned cells in the ventral hippocampus are specialized for fine-grained spatial discrimination. First, I want to point out that this is backwards: ventral cells have wider tuning than dorsal cells. The classic study of this is Kjelstrup et al. (2008, Science), not cited here (see also Komorowski et al., 2013, Journal of Neuroscience). Oddly, the authors cite two papers to support their claim about the dorsal-ventral axis (Lee et al., 2020. Tanni et al., 2022), neither of which actually support this claim. The Lee et al. paper only measures activity in dorsal cells, and it's not clear which subregion was measured in the Tanni paper."", 'Can the authors do a better job relating their work to existing literature (see Weaknesses)? I understand that due to space limitations it is unlikely that they will be able to comprehensively address this literature, but I want to make sure that the work is at least largely in alignment with what is known.']]]"
